the advance copy of <a href=\"http://hashtagmm.com/\">Michelle Miller’s The Underwriting</a>, she lays out the challenge she set for herself: “I wonder if it’s possible to create empathy for investment bankers. Like, would anyone ever care about any of the people in this room being stressed? It’s so pathetically privileged, isn’t it?” Miller makes a strong point: bankers just like the ones working at her fictional firm L Cecil (and at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/14/jp-morgan-chase-fines-legal-fees\">JP Morgan</a>, where Miller herself worked briefly) sank the economy in 2008 through sub-prime loans and credit-default swaps they instigated. Hardly any got punished. They aren’t exactly sympathetic characters. </p><p>But, the same way novelists create art out of all sorts of privilege, from lawyers to aristocrats to snobby prep schoolers, Miller not only gets the reader to care about the anxieties and secret desires of investment bankers of all stripes, she also spins an exciting piece of intrigue from the concept, and one so dully dependent on jargon and paperwork to boot.</p>","linkText":"The Underwriting by Michelle Miller review – a shrewd tale on cutthroat investment banking","lastModified":1432745059000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>You’d think it

Dre leaked. Called 2 Night and featuring Kendrick Lamar and Jeremih, it should have been a big deal. But the track – a breezy love tune that borrows from Erykah Badu’s hook on The Roots’ You Got Me – sounds so dated.</p><p>That’s probably because it is. Judging from Kendrick’s rapping style – his flow isn’t as dense as on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/28/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly-panel-verdict\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a> – the track was likely made three or four years ago. It may well have been intended for Dre’s album Detox, which has been anticipated for so long it’s the rap equivalent of Guns N Roses’ Chinese Democracy. Except that album actually came out, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/23/dr-dre-detox-final-album\">Detox likely never will</a>. In September, Dre’s collaborator Dawaun Parker revealed that it has been scrapped, adding that Dre was working on a different album. “I feel like one day, he’s gonna wake up and say, ‘Today’s the day,’ and put it out,” Parker told the <a href=\"http://shotsfiredpodcast.com/episode-79-liner-note-celebrity-dawaun-parker/\">Shots Fired! podcast</a>. “The music’s been there.” </p>","linkText":"Dr Dre's new track 2 Night proves his Detox diet isn't working","lastModified":1448461571000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The rapper and producer’s long-awaited album is probably never going to see the light of day, but with his ever diminishing returns is that a bad thing?</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498np","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/drdre","url":"/music/drdre","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Dr Dre","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/drdre","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/hip-hop","url":"/music/hip-hop","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Hip-hop","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/rap","url":"/music/rap","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Rap","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/ben-westhoff","url":"/profile/ben-westhoff","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Ben Westhoff","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-westhoff","twitterHandle":"Ben_Westhoff","bio":"<p>Ben Westhoff is the author of Dirty South, the former L.A.

Thankfully, we’ve moved on. It’s no longer 2014. This summer, for me, is going to be all about dirty barbecue. This has nothing to do with the other dirty food. This is way more literal. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/06/josh-ozersky-award-winning-food-writer-and-meat-fanatic-dies-aged-47\">late, great Josh Ozersky</a> cooked me some dirty steaks last year. If I’m honest, Ozersky had had a few bourbons and they could have been a little better, but he learned this trick from my mentor and US barbecue guru Adam Perry Lang, who also taught me a few years ago. He calls it “clinching”.</p><p>Dirty cooking is awesome in its simplicity. Instead of using fancy grills and barbecues, just grill the food directly in or on the hot charcoal. The most important thing is to use decent charcoal. Don’t use cheap briquettes and <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/04/grilling-lighting-the-fire-without-lighter-fluid.html\">dispense with chemical lighter fuels, too</a>. Get some nice charcoal online or from your local butcher that is made from wood and nowt much else – there are <a href=\"https://tregothnan.co.uk/from-the-woodlands/british-sustainable-charcoal-grab-bag.php\">plenty of companies </a> that <a href=\"http://www.treewoodcharcoal.com/\">sell additive-free briquettes.</a> You don’t even really need a barbecue, just charcoal, air and something to cook. If you have a normal barbecue, use that without the grill. Or you could “acquire” something like a metal shopping basket, placed on a few house bricks and filled with charcoal. You could probably use a cake cooling tray on some concrete or an old colander. Be innovative. All you need is something to put the charcoal in, air to get to the coals and a base that won’t go up in flames. </p>","linkText":"The dirty barbecue – awesome steaks made simple","lastModified":1432937022000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>You don’t need a barbecue this summer.

Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is freeing a group of women from sex slavery at the hands of the evil patriarch Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). The fact that those freed prisoners all look like <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/17960/actually-mad-max-fury-road-isnt-that-feminist\">supermodels dressed in lingerie</a> is a standard WIP trope. So is their growing battle-hardened resourcefulness and, for that matter, their commitment to feminist revolution. The end of the film is foreshadowed directly in Jonathan Demme’s cult WIP classic <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071266/reference\">Caged Heat</a>.</p>","linkText":"Mad Max: Fury Road is less radical than its B-movie influences","lastModified":1432671638599,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The film draws on ‘women in prison’ exploitation films, but its feminism and attitudes toward race are far less bold (Warning: spoilers)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497pp","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"film/mad-max-fury-road","url":"/film/mad-max-fury-road","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Mad Max: Fury Road","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"film/film","url":"/film/film","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black","url":"/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Orange is the New Black","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/noah-berlatsky","url":"/profile/noah-berlatsky","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Noah Berlatsky","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/noah-berlatsky","bio":"<p>Noah Berlatsky is the author of Wonder Woman: Bondage and Feminism.

In 2014 Coca-Cola took the unusual step of publicly criticising Fifa’s own investigation into corruption allegations surrounding Russia and Qatar’s bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. After Fifa cleared those bids its ethics chief Michael Garcia said he had been “misrepresented” and the report contained “numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions”.</p> <p>“Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the Fifa World Cup is a concern to us. The current conflicting perspectives regarding the investigation are disappointing. Our expectation is that this will be resolved quickly in a transparent and efficient manner,” Coke said at the time.

Nine of the governing body’s assorted wonks have been indicted by the frankly terrifying-sounding USA! USA!! USA!!! Department of Justice, on charges including but not limited to “racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies”. The lucky chaps are: Jeffrey Webb, Eugenio Figueredo, Eduardo Li, Julio Rocha, Costas Takkas, Rafael Esquivel, José Maria Marin, Nicolás Leoz and, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/15/said-and-done-fifa-report-special\">our old friend Jack Warner</a>.</p> <p>In addition, the Swiss authorities will be conducting their own investigation, during which they will have a word on the QT with 10 members of the Fifa ExCo who took part in that lovely old World Cup vote back in 2010. Those are: Issa Hayatou (Cameroon), Vitaly Mutko (Russia), Angel María Villar Llona (Spain), Michel D’Hooghe (Belgium), Senes Erzik (Turkey), Worawi Makudi (Thailand), Marios Lefkaritis (Cyprus), Jacques Anouma (Ivory Coast),<strong> </strong>Rafael Salguero(Guatemala) and Hany Abo Rida (Egypt). The Swiss attorney general says they’ll be asked about “criminal mismanagement and money laundering”, having seized assorted electronic data and documents from Fifa HQ.</p> <p>So, all in all, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested\">quite a day, and quite a collection of dignitaries</a>. And a day you would think is, to say the least, not ideal for Fifa given that the coronatio … sorry, election of Sepp Blatter as top dog, major domo and El Presidente is due to take place on Friday. Not a bit of it, mind, according to Fifa human shield Walter de Gregorio, who stepped up to face the world’s press as their collective jaw swung on its hinges: “This for Fifa is good. It is not good in terms of image or reputation, but in terms of cleaning up, this is good … It is not a nice day, but it is also a good day.” And on Sepp’s state of mind, for that is what we were all wondering about, De Gregorio repeatedly made clear that has boss had absolutely nothing to do with the officials he oversaw as president being arrested, and that he was “relaxed” but not “dancing in his office”.</p> <p>He wasn’t the only one declaring that there was nothing to see here. Warner released a statement saying: “I have fought fearlessly against all forms of injustice and corruption. I have been afforded no due process and I have not even been questioned in this matter. I reiterate that I am innocent of any charges. I have walked away from the politics of world football to immerse myself in the improvement of lives in this country where I shall, God willing, die.”</p> <p>It’s also worth noting what a few of those who are to be asked for their views on all of this had to say before about such allegations:</p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>Leoz, in 2013<strong>: “</strong>A while ago the press in England were at it, now the German press do it. I don’t know. What is it that drives these people?”</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Mutko, who in 2010 attacked the British press for “portraying Russia as a hotbed of corruption”, said: “We’re prepared to show everything.

The journalist was arrested soon after on the orders of police chief Sérgio Fleury and died in prison tafter undergoing repeated electric shocks. A year later, an unrepentant Marin praised Fleury for fulfilling his duties “in the most praiseworthy manner.”</p> <p>In 2013, the former Brazil striker Romario joined Ivo in presenting a petition to the CBF and Sepp Blatter urging Marin’s appointment be referred to the Fifa ethics committee for conduct unbecoming a football official. </p> <p>Romario had previously called Marin a thief and said he should “spend 100 years in prison” for taking a medal from a Corinthians player at a junior cup match. Marin responded by filing a lawsuit, but Romario was aquitted by the Supreme Court in April this year.</p> <p>Marin is a former São Paulo state governor, a post he won with the support of one of the most corrupt politicians in Brazil, Paulo Maluf who has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/brazil-mayor-millions-taxpayers-jersey\">found guilty</a> of taking hundreds of millions of dollars of bribes.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5565e0e1e4b0c345bfcb1a72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T16:21:15.359+01:00\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>(As an aside, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/fifa-corruption-crisis-key-figures-football\">here’s a look at the key figures in the indictment</a>, including the nine indicted parties: Jack Warner, Jeffrey Webb, Eugenio Figueredo, Julio Rocha, Eduardo Li, Rafael Esquivel, José Maria Marin, Costas Takkas, Nicolás Leoz.)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T16:30:22.155+01:00\">at 4.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5565e030e4b0ab5615399b10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T16:18:12.079+01:00\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>FBI director Comey is asked why it took so long for Fifa to be called out on the carpet.

Fifa’s spokesman Walter de Gregorio told the Associated Press: “He is not involved at all.”<br /></p> <p>• The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said the officials were arrested pending extradition to the US on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-face-corruption-charges-in-us.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=span-ab-top-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1\">The New York Times</a> reported that the charges arising from an FBI inquiry include wire fraud, racketeering and money laundering, with the US attorney general Loretta Lynch due to hold a news conference later on Wednesday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T10:38:29.815+01:00\">at 10.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-556570bce4b08ac403af4ab4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/clairephipps\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T08:23:31.402+01:00\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I’m handing this live blog over to my colleague <strong>David Hills</strong> now; he’ll take you through the rest of the morning, including the upcoming Fifa press conference at 11am Zurich time (10am BST).</p> <p>Thanks for reading.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55656fc3e4b04dea8dd84bf8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T08:22:01.675+01:00\">8.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Journalist <strong>Heidi Blake</strong>, who worked on <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/fifa/article1417325.ece\">the Sunday Times’ investigation into alleged Fifa corruption, the Fifa Files</a>, has welcomed today’s arrests:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HeidilBlake/statuses/603456872046288896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US really earning its spurs as world&#39;s policeman today after utter failure by any other authority to get FIFA&#39;s rampant corruption in check.</p>&mdash; Heidi Blake (@HeidilBlake) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeidilBlake/status/603456872046288896\">May 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And NBC’s <strong>Bill Neely</strong> makes this observation after it emerged that the US charges relate to alleged offences connected to tournaments in the US and Latin America:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BillNeelyNBC/statuses/603457469831114753\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Charging <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFA?src=hash\">#FIFA</a> officials on minor tournaments,not <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qatar2022?src=hash\">#Qatar2022</a> is like arresting Al Capone on tax charges. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/getyourman?src=hash\">#getyourman</a></p>&mdash; Bill Neely (@BillNeelyNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillNeelyNBC/status/603457469831114753\">May 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55656db5e4b05f67319af2a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T08:10:46.670+01:00\">8.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fifa has said it will hold a press conference at 11am (10am BST) at its Zurich headquarters.</strong></p> <p>Fifa executives (who have not been arrested) are currently meeting at HQ to discuss the morning’s developments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T08:12:22.592+01:00\">at 8.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55656ad5e4b05f67319af29d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T07:58:19.860+01:00\">7.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC is now reporting that it has confirmed the names of four of those arrested today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eduardo Li</strong></li> <li><strong>Jeffrey Webb</strong></li> <li><strong>Jose Maria Marin</strong></li> <li><strong>Eugenio Figueredo</strong></li> </ul> <p>Webb and Figueredo are Fifa vice-presidents.

What’s the story so far?Fifa corruption charges – live updates","body":"<h2><strong>What has happened?</strong></h2> <p>Fifa, the world governing body of football, has been plunged into crisis after a number of its top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (£65m). The dawn arrests in Zurich, where the organisation is based, came hours before Swiss prosecutors announced a criminal investigation into the 2018 and 2022 football World Cup bids. Fifa - the International Federation of Association Football - is in charge of organising football’s major tournaments, including the World Cup, which takes place every four years. </p> <p></p> <h2><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Who was arrested?</strong></h2> <p>Nine Fifa officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested, according to <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and\">the US Department of Justice</a>. The suspects were named as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jack Warner, </strong>the former Fifa vice-president </li> <li><strong>Jeffrey Webb</strong>, current Fifa vice-president and president of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) </li> <li><strong>Eugenio Figueredo</strong>, current Fifa vice-president and executive committee member</li> <li><strong>Eduardo Li</strong>, current Fifa executive committee member-elect</li> <li><strong>Julio Rocha</strong>, current Fifa development officer</li> <li><strong>Rafael Esquivel, </strong>president of the Venezuelan Football Federation</li> <li><strong>José Maria Marin, </strong>ex-president of the Brazilian Football Confederation</li> <li><strong>Costas Takkas</strong>, current attaché to the Concacaf president Jeffrey Webb</li> </ul> <p>According to the US Department of Justice, the sports marketing executives arrested were: <strong>Alejandro Burzaco</strong>, the controlling pincipal of Argentinian sports marketing firm Torneos y Competencias S.A; <strong>Aaron Davidson</strong>, president of Traffic Sports USA; <strong>Hugo and Mariano Jinkis</strong>, controlling principals of Argentinian sports marketing firm Full Play Group S.A. </p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Was Fifa president Sepp Blatter arrested?</strong><br /></h2> <p>No. Fifa spokesman <strong>Walter de Gregorio</strong> told the Associated Press: “He is not involved at all.” Blatter’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/seppblatter\">Twitter account</a>, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SeppBlatter/status/601328317032194048\">recently celebrated Fifa’s 111th birthday</a>, has remained silent on the arrests.</p> <h2><strong>What do the charges involve?</strong></h2> <p>The Fifa officials are accused of pocketing well over $150m in bribes in “brazen corruption” stretching back 24 years. US prosecutors <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and\">said</a> the football officials conspired with sports marketing executives to “shut out competitors and keep highly lucrative contracts for themselves through the systematic payment of bribes and kickbacks”. </p> <h2><strong>Could Russia and Qatar be stripped of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups?</strong></h2> <p>No country has ever been stripped of a World Cup, so this is without precedent. Such a move would be mired in legal complexities, with both Qatar and Russia likely to aggressively challenge any decision to strip them of the tournament on which both countries have already spent vast sums.</p> <p>However, it is equally likely that members of the rival bids – including Australia and the US for the 2022 World Cup, and Portugal and Spain for 2018 – will be looking closely at the details of Wednesday’s extraordinary developments with a view to applying for the bidding process to be reopened.</p> <p>Both World Cups have been mired in controversy since they were awarded on 2 December 2010. Yet Sepp Blatter has been adamant that nothing would derail either tournament, declaring as recently as last week after meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin that “nothing will get in the way of Russia hosting the best ever World Cup”. As he spoke, the FBI and Swiss police were preparing to make arrests that would throw the future of both World Cups into grave doubt.</p> <h2><strong>Why were the arrests made now?</strong></h2> <p>Swiss police appear to have timed the arrests to occur before Fifa’s annual general meeting on Friday, when they knew that a significant number of their suspects would be in the same city. Not just the same city, but the same hotel. The raid on the Baur au Lac, a luxury hotel with views overlooking the Alps, has long been favouredby Fifa officials visiting Zurich.</p> <h2><strong>Why are US authorities investigating Fifa?</strong></h2> <p>The US attorney general is due to hold a press conference on Wednesday when more details will become clear. However, the FBI has been investigating the process that led to the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals to Russia and Qatar respectively. News of the FBI investigation emerged in March 2013 with further details reported in November last year. It was reported that Chuck Blazer, a former Fifa executive committee member, was cooperating with the inquiry after he was approached over huge unpaid tax bills related to commissions he had received during his time as Concacaf general secretary.</p> <h2><strong>Who is Chuck Blazer?</strong></h2> <p>Chuck Blazer is a former Fifa executive committee member. Days before he was due to stand down in May 2013, he was suspended from football for 90 days by Fifa amid allegations that he fraudulently received more than $20m from Concacaf. </p> <p>The 70-year-old football chief has also held senior posts in America and is credited with turning the sport into a booming success in the US. And while US soccer’s fortunes flourished, so did Blazer’s. He earned the nickname Mr Ten Percent after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/the-rise-and-fall-of-chuck-blazer-the-man-who-built-and-bilk#.jxyDE612w\">reportedly negotiating an extraordinary contract with C</a>oncacaf that entitled him to 10% of just about every penny the body brought in. His colourful jet-set lifestyle matched his exuberance, and when he wasn’t living in his $18,000-a-month Manhattan apartment, he was probably relaxing at his luxury condo in the Bahamas.</p> <p>Last November it emerged that Blazer was cooperating with a US investigation into Fifa. Investigators were said to have approached Blazer in 2011 after allegedly discovering huge unpaid tax bills related to commissions he had received during his time as Concacaf general secretary. The New York Daily News, which broke the story in November 2014, reported that Blazer had secretly recorded Fifa executives for US investigators using a keychain fitted with a covert recording device.</p>","linkText":"Fifa corruption arrests: key questions answered","lastModified":1432745298290,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Six senior officials from football’s world governing body have been arrested on corruption charges in an early-morning raid in Zurich.

Jabbar left as one of the empty-handed customers at a Dayton, Ohio shopping mall on 20 December 2014 after lining up for the release of limited edition Air Jordan sneakers. After seeing two men who had secured one of the coveted pairs, Jabbar drew a gun and demanded the merchandise. <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/12/30/former-columbus-teen-killed-near-dayton.html\">The unidentified man holding the sneakers pulled out his own gun and shot back</a>. Jabbar was 16.<br /></p><p>Jabbar’s death complemented armed robberies in both New Jersey and Louisiana, a tear-gassed dispersal of prospective customers in Toledo, Ohio, and an April shooting in Houston, all of which centered around attempts to acquire the shoes. Since Air Jordans debuted in 1985, occasional violent crimes have accompanied their release because of the shoes’ limited supply, volatile demand, and price tags that sometimes exceed $200.

James is now just four wins away from bringing the NBA title home to Cleveland","body":"<p>LeBron James scored 23 points, Kyrie Irving returned after missing two games and the Cleveland Cavaliers reserved a spot in the NBA finals with a 118-88 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night to win the Eastern Conference title.</p> <p>By sweeping the top-seeded Hawks, the Cavs earned their second trip to the finals, where they will face either Golden State or Houston.</p> <p>It will be the fifth straight visit to the league’s showcase event for the inimitable James, who returned to Cleveland after four years in Miami to try and end a championship drought dating to 1964.</p> <p>The Cavs are four wins from doing so, and if they can, James will have a title that would put him in a class by himself. Other players have won more championships, but none has ever done it for his ring-starved home region. This is why he came back.</p> <p>Jeff Teague scored 17 and Paul Millsap 16 for Atlanta, which won a team-record 60 games during the regular season and made the conference finals for the first time since 1970. But the Hawks were no match for the Cavaliers and had no answer for James, who nearly averaged a triple-double in the four games.</p> <p>JR Smith added 18 points and Tristan Thompson had 16 points and 11 rebounds.</p> <p>It was a tough way for the Hawks to end a remarkable season. They survived a tumultuous offseason, and their young roster gelled in January when they became the first franchise to go 17-0 in a calendar month. They went on to win 19 straight, improved their record by 22 wins over last season and beat Brooklyn and Washington to make their first conference finals since 1994.</p> <p>But an injury to starting forward Thabo Sefolosha in April was followed by DeMarre Carroll injuring his knee in the series opener, before Kyle Korver’s season ended in Game 2 with an ankle injury.</p> <p>Those all hurt, but it was James who inflicted the most pain.</p> <p>James carried the Cavs to their first finals appearance in 2007, when they were swept by San Antonio. Cleveland were heavy underdogs then and it was assumed the Cavs would get back again. But James left in 2010 to join the Heat, a move that dropped the Cavaliers from relevance and into the draft lottery four straight years. But those days are over — Cleveland and King James reign supreme in the East.</p> <p>The Cavs got through the last two rounds without forward Kevin Love, who sustained a season-ending shoulder injury. His arrival last summer, joining James and Irving to form a Big 3, made Cleveland the team to beat in the East.</p> <p>It didn’t go exactly as planned under first-year coach David Blatt. The Cavs lost center Anderson Varejao to a season-ending Achilles injury in December and they were 19-20 before trading for Smith, Iman Shumpert and Timofey Mozgov, a trio that transformed Cleveland.</p> <p>Irving, who missed Cleveland’s previous two games with tendinitis in his left knee, scored 16 and the All-Star point guard looked better than he has in weeks.</p> <p>Unlike Game 3, when he missed his first 10 shots, James started much better and scored 15 in the first half as the Cavs opened a 17-point half-time lead. They pushed it to 20 early in the third, withstood a brief rally by the Hawks and spent the fourth quarter playing their reserves and getting ready for a party and some time off before the finals.</p> <p>This was Cleveland’s night from the start.</p> <p>Following pregame introductions, James slapped hands with members of owner Dan Gilbert’s family and then with his boss. The two mended their broken relationship last summer, paving the way for James to re-sign with the Cavs and try to deliver the title he couldn’t during his first stint.</p> <p>James had a bounce in his step and it wasn’t long before he delivered one of his patented windmill dunks, prompting the Hawks to call a timeout while James ran the length of the baseline screaming at Cleveland fans to “Get up!”</p> <p>Moments later, Irving showed he could get up after being knocked down. He drove to the basket for a layup and was fouled hard. Irving, though, quickly popped to his feet and James, who was on the bench at the time, walked several feet onto the floor to salute his team-mate.</p> <p>The Cavs know they’ll need a healthy Irving to take the next step — the one to the top.</p>","linkText":"Cleveland Cavaliers sweep Atlanta Hawks and breeze into NBA finals","lastModified":1432696497457,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<ul><li>Atlanta

But after a few moments of levity he was focus personified. The six-times Olympic gold medal winner made a customary slow start, with the American Isiah Young getting the early advantage, but the 28-year-old took complete control round the corner and powered home in 20.13sec.</p> <p>Despite winning by a comfortable 0.22sec over Young, Bolt – who kept running at full tilt across the line – was visibly unimpressed and underlined his determination to be at the top of his game for the world championships in Beijing in August. “It was difficult as it was a little bit colder than I thought it would be,” he said. “I just need to try to get myself into running shape. It’s all about the work and the technique.”</p> <p>It was the second time Young had finished second behind a Jamaican sprinter after being edged out by Asafa Powell in the 100m earlier on. Like Bolt, Powell did not have the best start but he began to pull away after about 60m to take the victory in 10.04s. Although Powell was unable to add to the 84 times he has broken the 10-second barrier, he will be pleased to have been so close in the wet weather.</p> <p>Young crossed the line in 10.13 while Britain’s Richard Kilty continued his bid to replicate indoor success outdoors by finishing third in 10.31.</p> <p>His fellow Briton James Ellington finished sixth in 10.45, before he returned for the 200m race and was impressive, finishing fourth in running 20.81.</p>","linkText":"Usain Bolt comfortably wins 200m at Golden Spike event in

Every now and again, a league premised on a gimmick pops up – like the WWE-backed <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/58829/good-honest-football-re-watching-xfl\">eXtreme Football League</a>, or the way ahead of its time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ouXw328WYI\">trampoline-and-basketball hybrid Slamball</a> – but there hasn’t been a competitor big enough or rich enough to put into question which league boasts the best talent in the world. Not since the United States Football League (USFL) closed up shop after its 1985 season, 30 years ago, has there been a legitimate competitor to keep the major leagues honest.</p><p>It can be easy to forget in this era of gigantic, monolithic leagues – in which all four major leagues pull in billions of dollars of revenue yearly and in which MLB, NBA and NHL all own entire developmental leagues to pull talent from – that it wasn’t always like this. Throughout the history of American sports the major sports leagues have been shaped by competition. Upstart leagues, from the American League to the American Basketball Association to the World Hockey Association, are as much responsible for the things we enjoy most about sports as the major leagues still around today.</p>","linkText":"Racial equality, three-pointers and big money: why US sports need rival leagues","lastModified":1432721022000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>If American sports wants to thrive, somebody, somewhere will have to challenge the establishment to keep up</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495hj","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"sport/us-sport","url":"/sport/us-sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"US sports","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/nfl","url":"/sport/nfl","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"NFL","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/nba","url":"/sport/nba","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"NBA","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/nhl","url":"/sport/nhl","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"NHL","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/nhl","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/mlb","url":"/sport/mlb","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"MLB","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/baseball","url":"/sport/baseball","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Baseball","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/baseball","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/sport","url":"/sport/sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/blog","url":"/sport/blog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sportblog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on football, tennis, cricket and the latest sports stories","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/jack-moore","url":"/profile/jack-moore","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Jack Moore","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jack-moore","bio":"<p>Jack Moore is a freelance sports writer based in Minneapolis, MN covering the politics and history of sport.

used to be an MMA fan until I discovered how many of its athletes are treated in a brutal sport<br>","body":"<p>In June, UFC champion Ronda Rousey will appear in the film adaption of Entourage. It is one of Rousey’s many mainstream incursions, <a href=\"http:// http://www.si.com/mma/2015/05/12/ronda-rousey-mma-sports-illustrated-cover\">which also recently included a place on the cover of Sports Illustrated</a>.</p> <p>Her bosses at UFC, as you might guess, are overjoyed by the attention. Ronda Rousey’s profile only improves their business (<a href=\"http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/5/23/8647977/ufc-dana-white-ronda-rousey-makes-3m-a-year-in-sponsorships\">and she is estimated to make $3m a year in sponsorship alone</a>). After closing <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/6874530/ufc-reaches-seven-year-broadcast-deal-fox-networks \">a $100m-a-year deal with Fox Sports and an agreement with Reebok to uniform fighters</a>, the UFC is with Rousey’s help poised to vault mixed martial arts into the public eye as never before.</p> <p>I have observed the latest news with mixed emotions. As a former fan of MMA, I cannot help but admire the skill and dedication of the athletes. However, real labor protection for athletes is long overdue.</p> <p>Watching in a bar or a big screen at home, you would think the slick production and pro wrestling-style swag would mean big money for an athlete who chooses MMA. The dollars seem great on the face of it. When you look at the base salaries in other professional sports and the risks, it’s hard to see an upside.</p> <p>Consider an April card, where Dustin Poirier, an experienced, high-profile competitor, <a href=\"http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fight-night-63-salaries-clay-guida-chad-mendes-earn-largest-disclosed-paydays\">earned $68,000, which included a $34,000 win bonus</a>. In a good year, a fighter gets three or four fights. Assuming this is an average salary, if Poirier stayed injury-free (during which time there’s no pay) and won all his fights, with maybe a bump or two, he could take home $300,000 for four victories.</p> <p>This seems like a decent amount, until you consider other sports. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/01/23/average-mlb-salary-nearly-double-nfls-but-trails-nba-players/\">Forbes reported</a> that in the 2013-14 season the average NFL salary was $2m, MLB $3.82m and NBA $4.9m (admittedly these leagues create larger revenues but the discrepancy shows most MMA fighters are far from millionaires). More importantly, Poirier is classified as an independent contractor with a tax burden that is far different than an employee. Should he get injured, lose or not get a bonus, the annual compensation dips significantly. Less experienced athletes often make much less, even in a good year.</p> <p>What’s more, minimum money is at the discretion of a promoter. Fighter salaries are a festering problem. Bleacher Report examined one contract, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1516575-the-business-of-fighting-a-look-inside-the-ufcs-top-secret-fighter-contract\">a more lucrative one than Poirier’s in fact</a>, where a labor law professor concluded basic standards are non-existent. In a competition where serious injury is nearly inevitable, such baselines are necessary.</p> <p><a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-new-ufc-reebok-deal-is-screwing-fighters-out-of-so-1704258703\">Fresh disputes over sponsorships</a>, where the promotion requires athletes to wear uniforms from the UFC’s business partner while depriving themselves of valuable self-directed sponsor money, have spilled out on to social media. <a href=\"http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/3/21/8268695/ufc-lawsuit-two-more-fighters-file-antitrust-complaint-against-zuffa\">A series of class-action lawsuits by fighters and former stars</a> have alleged unfair labor practices and monopolistic behavior by the UFC, which does not favor workers or fans.</p> <p><a href=\"http:// http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-07-03/ufc-fighters-get-pummeled-for-a-living-and-the-pay-stinks\">The UFC staunchly defends its compensation</a>. Underlying that defense is a tone that sneers at organized athletes. That should come as no surprise.<a href=\"http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/6/24/1534570/fertittas-federal-indictment-may?_ga=1.225552348.796233873.1432062571\"> The UFC is co-owned by notoriously anti-union casino bosses Lorenzo and Frank Fertita</a>. Yet in a world where every athlete from tennis players to a baseball pitchers have basic labor rights, the free-for-all MMA industry is practically prehistoric. Fighters have no promise of support after their careers are over, as most professional sportsmen do. Collective bargaining, consideration as employees, unions and basic rights as professionals simply are not there.</p> <p>Many fans and promoters counter that an MMA career is a choice and, if athletes don’t like it, they don’t need to fight. That’s shortsighted. One’s willingness to compete in a brutal sport for shameful pay because enthusiasm, poverty or few other options compels you to do so is not the highest moment for athletic competition. It would seem that kind of retort, which relies on the caricatures of barroom brawlers and backyard fistfights, is precisely what a professional sport should argue against.</p> <p>Journalists Ben Fowlkes and Chad Dundas <a href=\"http://www.comainevent.com/co-main-event-podcast-episode-153-51114/\">asked how fans can support a sport where the incomes and futures of athletes is tenuous at best</a>. My answer is simple: you can’t.</p> <p>I stopped being an MMA fan when I could no longer reconcile the disparities and lack of minimum standards. My entertainment, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mma-cagewriter/ufc-legend-mark-coleman-turns-to-crowd-funding-site-to-help-pay-for-medical-bills-021340753-mma.html \">knowing today’s fighters could end up like pioneer Mark Coleman who is crowdfunding his medical bills</a>, is not worth it. More fans need to abandon the sport until labor protection is prioritized.</p> <p>Legislation and labor action benefit the whole and improve a sport’s potential to grow – the overall quality of competition improves when the livelihood athletes can expect improves.</p> <p>MMA is at a crucial juncture. Rousey’s rise and the UFC’s television and Reebok deals are increasing the sport’s mainstream access as never before. It’s up to fans to speak now on business practices that have troubling implications.</p>","linkText":"Ronda Rousey makes $3m a year but most UFC fighters don't get what they

Sam says his priority is helping the Montreal Alouettes win, not making history as the first openly gay player in the Canadian Football League","body":"<p>Michael Sam says his priority is helping the Montreal Alouettes win, not making history as the first openly gay player in the Canadian Football League. Sam signed a two-year deal with the Alouettes last week.</p> <p>“I’m not trying to really do anything historic here by being with Montreal, I’m just trying to help the team win some games so we can bring the Grey Cup back home,” Sam said at packed news conference on Tuesday.</p> <p>The 25-year-old came out publicly before last year’s NFL draft. He was selected in the seventh round by the St Louis Rams to become the first openly gay player chosen by an NFL team. The Rams cut him in training camp. The Dallas Cowboys signed him to their practice squad but released him in October. Sam starred at Missouri in college, earning SEC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2013.</p> <p>Alouettes general manager Jim Popp, who called Sam a “trailblazing athlete,” said he believes the 6ft 2in, 260lbs player can excel as a pass rusher in the CFL. Sam agreed. “My size fits as a pass rusher,” Sam said. “I led my team in preseason in sacks and that was in the NFL, so I’m a pass rusher. Doesn’t matter where I’m at.”</p> <p>Sam was considered by NFL teams to be a “tweener,” not quite the right body type to be a defensive end or an outside linebacker for that league. But Popp believes Sam can follow a path similar to Cam Wake, who was converted from linebacker to end when he joined the BC Lions in 2007. Wake was the CFL Defensive Player of the Year in each of his two seasons before signing with the Miami Dolphins, where he has had a successful NFL career.</p> <p>Sam said he became comfortable with his sexual orientation in his senior year in college and told his coach and team-mates. He came out publicly in February 2014. “There was a reason why I came out to my team, because I didn’t want to live a life behind the closet anymore,” he said. “Eventually it was going to come out anyway, so I have no regrets. I’m happy with myself. I’m living my life the way I want to live.”</p> <p>After he came out, Sam’s NFL jersey was an instant best-seller. The Alouettes have already put his No94 jersey on sale on its website.</p> <p>While Sam wants to be seen as just another football player, he knows his decision to reveal his sexuality comes with a

are still being arrested for beating up women – maybe they need one of their own to warn them of the price of abuse<br>","body":"<p>On 28 August<sup> </sup>last year, shamed by the mishandling of the Ray Rice case, the NFL announced a stringent new domestic violence policy. As a refresher, highlights include a six-game ban for a first offense and a lifetime ban for a second.<br /></p> <p>Unfortunately the new policy has done absolutely nothing to change the culture, as domestic violence arrests amongst NFL players remain as prevalent as ever. Here’s a small sample since the policy was enacted. Lions offensive lineman Rodney Austin: <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/04/21/lions-cut-rodney-austin-target-linemen-draft/26116997/\">arrested and charged with four misdemeanor counts, one of which was shoving a woman holding an infant</a>. 49ers fullback Bruce Miller: <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_28045426/santa-clara-49ers-bruce-miller-charged-misdemeanor-vandalism\">arrested on a misdemeanor domestic battery charge</a>. Colts linebacker Josh McNary: <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2015/03/11/josh-mcnary-defense-challenges-accusers-credibility-rape-case/70166690/\">charged with rape</a>. Saints linebacker Junior Galette: <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000454618/article/saints-junior-galette-arrested-booked-with-simple-battery\">arrested and booked on misdemeanor charges of domestic violence and battery</a>. </p> <p>Then there’s the disturbing frequency with which defensive end Ray McDonald can’t seem to keep his hands off women. McDonald’s first domestic violence arrest came less than a week after Roger Goodell announced the new policy. His second arrest, this time for sexual assault, led to his release by the San Francisco 49ers. McDonald, arrested over the weekend for the third time in nine months, this time for misdemeanor domestic violence and child endangerment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/25/chicago-bears-defensive-end-ray-mcdonald-arrested-on-suspicion-of-domestic-violence\">was released by the Chicago Bears before he ever played a down</a>. </p> <p>McDonald clearly can’t stay out of the headlines. But the allegations against players this off-season bring to light a sad truth. The NFL can increase penalties for abusers and give up valuable ad space to domestic violence adverts, but the culture hasn’t budged one iota, and that extends beyond the players. Bears chairman George McCaskey when vetting the troubled McDonald this spring forgot the vetting part.</p> <p>“An alleged victim, I think – much like anyone else who has a bias in this situation – there’s a certain amount of discounting in what they have to say,” said McCaskey as his rationale for not speaking to McDonald’s accuser. </p> <p>Whether McDonals is found guilty or not, it would have been a good idea to dig deeper into his personal life. Instead McCaskey spoke to McDonald’s mom to make sure he was a good guy. Hoping for the best is not only ignorant, but a dangerous message to send.</p> <p>Despite the league’s efforts, a shift in culture almost feels impossible. Perhaps the lethal cocktail of tackling for a living and taking supplements to achieve maximum performance is too much to keep those predisposed to violence at bay. While team executives, coaches and owners only care about winning, the reality is sobering.</p> <p>But if there’s one individual who could possibly make even a small difference, it’s the poster child for the league’s domestic violence issue: Ray Rice. </p> <p>First Rice needs to be signed by a team, a distinct possibility ESPN’s John Clayton <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12926969/cowboys-teams-pursue-ray-rice-training-camp-nfl\">foresees come training camp</a>. Imagine Rice, on the NFL stage, spreading his message of deep regret. What a departure from other players – who have exacerbated the problem by not only failing to acknowledge involvement in their respective cases but deflecting blame upon their accusers. It’s the classic domestic violence story. </p> <p>Rice has been remorseful from the start, even if the NFL’s handling of the case was woefully mishandled. He acknowledged that he failed miserably. He choked up when publicly apologizing to his father-in-law. Most importantly, Rice has been open and honest about what happened that fateful night in Atlantic City. His wife, Janay, has also <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11913473/janay-rice-gives-own-account-night-atlantic-city\">described the events</a> in great detail. </p> <p>Like Michael Vick’s return from a prison stint for his role in a dogfighting ring, a Rice return would be met with much vitriol. Protestors – led by women’s groups – are easy to envision. They may not stop Rice from earning an NFL paycheck once again but their message and the media attention it would produce, could only be helpful in having an honest look at the domestic violence epidemic. </p> <p>Rice is the perfect candidate to speak to rookies about his experience and warn them to avoid that path – in the insular world of the NFL they are far more likely to listen to a fellow player than an outsider. He could start a new foundation that directly aids victims of domestic violence or provides funding for domestic violence hotlines. Instead of the muted actors seen during the in-game PSAs, it could be Rice that pops on our screen and actually speaks about the perils of domestic violence. </p> <p>If Rice is willing to be candid about his history of domestic violence – and by the looks of it he is – then hopefully he’s got enough football talent left to make a team. The NFL could really use his help because the status quo is failing. </p>","linkText":"The NFL still has a domestic violence problem – and Ray Rice could help solve

The bad news is that Novak Djokovic is still in the French Open and rumbling with equal menace towards the quarter-finals, where they are due to collide for the 44th time – on the Spaniard’s 29th birthday next Wednesday.</p> <p>While the gap between last year’s finalists might have narrowed from the yawning chasm that had opened up on clay over the past couple of months, the Serb still looks like the best player in the world, on any surface under any conditions on any day of the week.</p> <p>Even if going 4-1 down in the second set against Jarkko Nieminen on Court Philippe Chatrier on Tuesday afternoon hinted at brief early jitters, the result was never in doubt. The player who has not lost in 22 matches and sits on top of the rankings with an unassailable 4,000-plus points lead, closed it out 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in a couple of ticks over two hours, and he retains the swagger he needs to win this title for the first time.</p> <p>Nadal, winless on European clay from four attempts coming to Roland Garros, beat the 296th-ranked Quentin Halys 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, and the hitherto anonymous 18-year-old French wild card might never have tried harder for such inevitable defeat in front of so many of his compatriots.</p> <p>Seeded seventh here for the first time since his rise to prominence, Nadal was precise, brutal and clearly impatient to rediscover the sort of efficiency that has delivered him nine titles here in 10 years. “I started a little bit slow, then [after three games] I started moving the ball better,” Nadal said. “I am happy. It is the first match. I played well enough. I think my forehand worked well for a lot of moments. I had some ups and downs during the season; it is normal that can happen here. I am trying to avoid that.”</p> <p>He did not strike a single ace in an hour and 50 minutes but neither did he appear to strain for one. His priority was accuracy, which hit 78% on his first serve in the concluding set, as he powered it down to an average of 153kph. Halys, lightly bearded but heavily callow, took one of two break points that came his way but, ferociously as he struck his ground strokes, he could not take the sting from Nadal’s relentless top-spun replies and hit 52 unforced errors. The champion also hurt the teenager at the net, winning the point on 14 of 16 visits.</p> <p>At the end the sometimes fickle French crowd gave their Spanish king a standing ovation, unusual for a perfunctory first-round win against one of their own, and perhaps there was a touch of guilt for past indifference to his genius or maybe pity for his recent struggles. The French love ambivalence.</p> <p>“Quentin is the future, a new-style of game, big serve, trying to hit winners from everywhere,” Nadal said courtside, returning the sentiment of amiability. “I wish him all the best.” That, too, was well received, so there were mind games at play all over the place.</p> <p>Nadal, incidentally, has reverted to his hi-tech, French-made Babolat racket, pushing buttons on the top of the handle during breaks to register stats to crunch before his second-round match against his compatriot Nicolas Almagro, who took two hours and 26 minutes to beat Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6.</p> <p>Djokovic, though, had the stiffer test against a seasoned 33-year-old opponent, holding on to a world ranking of No 87 and determined to give of his best on the centre court of a major; there cannot be many such opportunities left for him.</p> <p>Nieminen played artfully at times but Djokovic had too much of everything for him, winning 104 of the available 182 available points, with 40 clear winners and half a dozen aces.</p> <p>He rarely appeared pressured to move into top gear but, during his minor difficulty in the second set, gave the impression he would find a way to stop the contest going to four sets. “I played some good shots, stayed calm and overall it was a good performance,” Djokovic said.</p> <p>As for the Nadal challenge, he said:“The conditions suit him very much. His record says much about the quality of the tennis he plays here. Best of five is something that plays in his favour because there are not many players who can compete physically against him. He’s one of the best defenders ever to player the game.”</p> <p>On Court No1 the American Jack Sock had the best win of his career when he comfortably beat an out-of-sorts No10 seed, Grigor Dimitrov, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3, a hard-drilled forehand into the ad corner finishing the Bulgarian off after an hour and 55 minutes.</p>","linkText":"Rafael Nadal eases past Quentin Halys in French Open first round","lastModified":1435406755000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"• Defending champion beats 18-year-old qualifier 6-3, 6-3, 6-4<br />• Djokovic sees off Jarkko Nieminen 6-4, 7-5, 6-2<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/25/andy-murray-kyle-edmund-french-open-second-round\" title=\"\">• Andy Murray joined by Kyle Edmund in second round</a>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498ee","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"sport/rafaelnadal","url":"/sport/rafaelnadal","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/french-open-2015","url":"/sport/french-open-2015","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"French Open 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/french-open-2015","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/novak-djokovic","url":"/sport/novak-djokovic","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/frenchopen","url":"/sport/frenchopen","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"French Open","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/frenchopen","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/tennis","url":"/sport/tennis","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Tennis","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/sport","url":"/sport/sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/matchreports","url":"/tone/matchreports","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Match reports","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kevinmitchell","url":"/profile/kevinmitchell","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kevinmitchell","bio":"<p>Kevin Mitchell is the tennis and boxing correspondent for the Guardian and Observer.

MLS Cup holders are suffering a familiar slump, there was no home comfort for Kreis and Jones is still the midfielder warrior that New England need","body":"<h2><strong>Galaxy rescued in familiar fashion but familiar problems remain</strong></h2> <p>The experiences of 2012 should always stand as warning against writing off any LA Galaxy team coached by Bruce Arena. That year, a tepid start from the defending champions looked set to slide LA into crisis, only for a summer rally to build a momentum that did not let up until the Galaxy swept to a back to back MLS Cup in their own stadium.</p> <p>In the couple of seasons since, a slow start has come to be the norm for LA, so it was only in the past couple of weeks that many neutrals began looking at the Galaxy’s points thus far and noticing that it was only a little different from the total that was described as a crisis in 2012.</p> <p>And once again the Galaxy are defending champions, though this is a different side from the team that won last year, and their problems may not be so easily fixed. </p> <p>The most recent problem has been the absence, due to lingering injury, of Robbie Keane, whose finishing has been missed. Though it’s arguably just as significant for the team that they have also been missing his movement and intelligence and the space and options it buys for the players around him. Gyassi Zardes in particular made an exponential improvement in his own movement last year by running routes that at times looked like they were set down paint-by-numbers style by Keane.</p> <p>And after last week’s humiliation in Orlando, the Galaxy were definitely under scrutiny this week – compounded of course by the stadium announcement by LAFC that promised to deliver a downtown LA stadium by 2018 (by a slightly generous definition of “downtown” admittedly, though hardly the Carson location that hosts the StubHub Center). </p> <p>That distraction aside – and let it be noted the Galaxy viral marketers were immediately out in force fly-posting the proposed site of the LAFC stadium with posters that boasted of the incumbent team’s storied history – the prospect of facing Houston and an in-form and lively Giles Barnes was plenty enough to deal with this weekend for LA, so the return of Keane was a welcome relief.</p> <p>So too was the familiar site of a late Alan Gordon goal, the ultimate difference between the sides, created by a typical turn and perfectly placed chip cross by Keane to find Gordon’s head. </p> <p>Yet rather than suggesting service as usual, this was more of a welcome outcome to somewhat of a sobering encounter for the Galaxy, who were given plenty of problems in midfield by Barnes et al, in a reminder of the other great structural problem they’ve had this year. The pre-season departure of Marcelo Sarvas will not be adequately addressed until the arrival of Steven Gerrard, and even then the traditional designated player learning curve is likely to be in effect as the Englishman adjusts to his new team-mates and vice versa. </p> <p>This week Keane spoke of Gerrard coming to LA to win things as that was the expectation in this town. Under the circumstance that can be read less as a pre-emptive defense of his former Liverpool team-mate’s level of motivation, and more of a note of encouragement to his future Galaxy team-mate that there won’t be much time posing on the welcome mat before he’s expected to carry his share of the heavy lifting. Once again, the Galaxy need to find some urgency in the summer. <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2><strong>No home comfort for Kreis</strong></h2> <p>Last week it looked as if NYCFC had finally, finally, turned a corner, as their 10 men hauled in a 2-0 Chicago Fire lead to take a late point at Yankee Stadium. </p> <p>And with Jason Kreis’s team on the road at his former Real Salt Lake home this week, NYC’s head coach might have dared to imagine that his side were ready to build some precious momentum at his old stomping ground, particularly with RSL looking far from the consistent force he’d left them as.</p> <p>Instead, the broader momentum of this year, one that sees NYCFC continually losing ground as they try to run uphill, continued on Saturday night, as they fell behind in the opening half hour, for the eighth time this season, and never recovered.</p> <p>It’ll be little consolation to Kreis that the goals that defeated his team came from two archetypal representatives of how he built his RSL sides – youth and a central axis made up of experienced veterans. </p> <p>With 25 minutes gone, John Stertzer scored his first ever MLS goal since being picked by Kreis in his last ever draft for RSL in 2013 – part of the coach’s continuum of capturing and moulding young technical talent at his former club. And with four minutes of the second half gone, Alvaro Saborio, the Costa Rican spearhead of Kreis’s successful RSL teams, did what he does and delivered a second goal for the hosts and something of a gut punch to the evening’s honored guest.</p> <p>We know the mitigating circumstances by now – and trying to build debut season chemistry in a team stretched unnaturally thin by injuries in its opening few months is a legitimate problem that can hardly be laid at Kreis’s door. But as the coach honestly admitted this week, the team’s habit of conceding early has left them chasing games, and even an RSL side on a rebuilding curve was never likely to give up a two-goal lead in the manner Chicago had.</p> <p>Funnily enough Chicago, whose lack of ruthlessness in front of goal had allowed NYCFC back into the game last week, spent Friday night clawing back a 2-0 deficit of their own, with Jason Johnson hitting an equalizer deep into injury time. </p> <p>Last week, Johnson’s miss at almost the same stage, kept New York within a goal and allowed Khiry Shelton to equalize seconds later – sparking local hopes that NYCFC were finally getting their share of luck after a tough start. </p> <p>But as it turned out that was as good as it got for Kreis this week – left picking the bones out of another defeat on a day that started with smiles among familiar faces and ended with an inquest into familiar problems. <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jones still the midfield warrior New England Revolution need</strong></h2> <p>As Wednesday’s 4-2 defeat to Sporting KC proved, central defence probably isn’t the position for Jermaine Jones. Before the midweek loss he had actually proved a sufficient enough deputy for the injured Jose Goncalves, but the US international was run ragged by the duo of Dom Dwyer and Krisztian Nemeth – effectively marking the end of Jay Heaps’ improvised, tactical compromise. And so against DC United Jones returned as the midfield warrior the New England Revolution need him to be.</p> <p>Starting in his familiar – more comfortable – central position alongside Scott Caldwell, the 33-year-old could be credited with safeguarding a point for the Revolution, when such a result looked unlikely. DC United probably should have claimed all three for themselves - following the dismissal of both Chris Tierney and Lee Nguyen within six minutes of each other midway through the second half - but Jones turned in arguably his best display of the season (just days after his worst) to deny the capital club.</p> <p>By moving Jones back into the centre of midfield Heaps opted for Andrew Farrell at the back, where the 23-year-old excelled. Normally something of a flaky performer, Farrell had shown little in his appearances at right-back to suggest he could fill in as a central defender, but against DC he was disciplined, positionally-sound and generally impressive next to the returning Goncalves. A harsh critic might point out that Farrell was partly at fault for Arrieta’s equaliser, but with the Revs down to nine men such a lapse was mostly the consequence of others’ mistakes, not his own.</p> <p>Although New England may have expected more of a challenge, given the circumstance. Despite the two-man advantage Ben Olsen’s side was somewhat flat – even insipid – as they chased the game at 1-0 down in the final half hour. Jairo Arrieta grabbed an equaliser with 10 minutes to go, but that was with DC United’s first shot on goal – illustrating just how toothless their attack was in Foxborough and perhaps underlining just how important Fabian Espindola is.</p> <p>Jones has only been at New England for nine months, and his stint up until this point must go down as a roaring success. But the midfielder must be afforded the freedom to roar as a central destroyer: blood spattered face, ripped shirt and all. With players like Lee Nguyen and Juan Agudelo missing through injury earlier in the season Jones was used as a creative stop-gap farther up the field, but with the Revs now close to full fitness there’s no need for him to play there any longer. His versatility makes him a natural back-up option all over the field, but the contrast of Jones’ last two performances must indicate to Heaps that the 33-year-old is the last player he should shift. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Sporting KC’s improvement comes from finding</strong><strong> identity again</strong></h2> <p>Sporting KC’s progress over the past few weeks has been incremental, but that any progress has been made at all is reason enough for Peter Vermes to raise a rare smile. Two wins and three draws from five games is hardly the form of a team storming into conference title contention – even if two of those draws have come on the road at DC United and Seattle – yet their improvement can be charted on the quality of those performances rather than the results.</p> <p>The 2013 MLS Cup winners have at least a semblance of their old character as a team back. Once the most defensively resolute, relentless high-pressers in the league, the 4-4 draw against the Houston Dynamo suggested that Vermes’ side had lost what made them so good not so long ago. Injuries were of course a factor in that, but regardless Sporting KC appeared to be suffering something of an identity crisis.</p> <p>Since then however, Sporting have won both home games they have played, also claiming points on the road at DC United and at the Seattle Sounders on Saturday night. The point picked up at CenturyLink Field was all the more impressive given the injuries endured by KC this season, with Vermes also losing Dwyer through neck soreness in the pre-game warm-up. The injury forced Vermes’ hand, with Nemeth moved up front as the lone striker in a switch that ultimately worked in the away side’s favour – with Seattle unable to break down Sporting’s packed midfield unit. In fact, it took the Sounders until the 82nd minute to fire off their first shot on goal. “That shows the level of concentration by our guys,” said Vermes afterwards. “This was a humungous point for us on the road, based on the situation we were in and are in with as many injuries as we have at the moment.” </p> <p>Such central rigidity was in stark contrast to the harum-scarum performances turned in by Sporting earlier in the campaign, like the one against Houston or even the display against Philadelphia in early April, when the struggling Union shredded KC’s midfield almost at will. At no point did the Sounders cause Sporting such issues.</p> <p>While a goalless draw against a decidedly short-handed Sporting KC side certainly cannot be heralded as a triumph, a sixth shutout in 11 games provides something of a silver-lining for Sigi Schmid. And with the Sounders drawing their first blank in five matches the result would seem to be little more than a mere blip in their tilt at the top of the Western Conference.</p> <p>Now with some sense of defensive solidity returned to their play, Vermes must find a way to restore his side’s former attacking prowess. The point at Seattle might have been a “humungous” one but it was achieved by sitting deep, conceding 65% of possession to Seattle and plugging the gaps. This wasn’t the Sporting KC of old, but they are at least closer to the mark. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>The East is tightening up as summer begins</strong></h2> <p> Just a few weeks ago, the Eastern Conference was beginning to look like a two tier league, or at least one where the top four or five playoff places could already be sketched in. Even before last week’s games some of those distinctions still seemed pretty clear. </p> <p> This is MLS though, and fast forward through a week in which New England have dropped seven points from three games, and where the Red Bulls and DC each ended up taking only a point from two, and the swing for the likes of Montreal and Philadelphia, with two wins each, seems even more pronounced.</p> <p> Montreal, of course, barely played at the start of the season, as they concentrated on a Champions League tilt that took them to a surprise final appearance. At the time the talk was of the lowest ranked team in MLS flying the flag for the league, but in truth the Impact are already a much better team than the one that limped through the regular season last year, and while they rode their luck against Dallas in an eye-catching win this weekend, their habit of punishing errors has carried over from their CCL adventures.</p> <p> Philadelphia meanwhile, scored an injury time winner against DC United last week to end a poor run, before getting their first ever win at Red Bull Arena on Sunday night. The Union needed their own share of luck in surviving two shots off the woodwork in the first half and some showboating by Mike Grella of all players, but took their limited chances admirably in the second to fashion the makings of an unlikely winning streak.</p> <p> After the game Union coach Jim Curtin acknowledged that he’d told his players their season could go in one of two directions this week, and certainly rather than the Red Bulls becoming a team disappearing over the horizon, the one-time frontrunners now find themselves having won only one more time than a Philadelphia team whose fans carried a coffin saying “We Deserve Better” to last week’s game.</p> <p>And with Montreal starting their run, Sebastian Giovinco scoring another spectacular goal to take Toronto past Portland, and Chicago finding confidence if not three points in coming back from 2-0 down against Columbus, Philadelphia couldn’t have timed their little burst better. The summer period of international absences, European friendlies, incoming designated player reshuffles (Lampard, Gerrard et al), often has the effect of muddying the picture in both conferences, and it can also be hard for a team to pick up meaningful momentum in that time, especially if they’re caught behind the pack (though last year’s New England example shows what’s possible for those that do). A few teams in the East may have a lot of work to do, but nobody’s pulling clear right now. <strong>GP</strong></p>","linkText":"Steven Gerrard exits disappointing Liverpool ... for disappointing LA Galaxy","lastModified":1432554462468,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The MLS Cup holders are suffering a familiar slump, there was no home comfort for Kreis and Jones is still the midfielder warrior that New England need<br></p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497ay","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"football/mls","url":"/football/mls","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"MLS","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/mls","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"football/football","url":"/football/football","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/sport","url":"/sport/sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/us-sport","url":"/sport/us-sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"US sports","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"football/liverpool","url":"/football/liverpool","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Liverpool","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool","description":"Read the latest Liverpool news, transfer rumours, match reports, fixtures and live scores from the Guardian","references":[{"id":"pa-football-team/9","type":"pa-football-team"}]}},{"properties":{"id":"football/losangelesgalaxy","url":"/football/losangelesgalaxy","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"LA Galaxy","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/blog","url":"/sport/blog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sportblog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on football, tennis, cricket and the latest sports stories","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"football/steven-gerrard","url":"/football/steven-gerrard","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Steven Gerrard","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/steven-gerrard","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned","url":"/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"MLS: five things we learned","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned","description":"A weekly roundup of the best stories and videos in Major League Soccer","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/graham-parker","url":"/profile/graham-parker","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Graham Parker","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/graham-parker","bio":"<p>Graham Parker is a writer based in Brooklyn, New York.

writers name their player of the season, the best goal, the best match, the worst flops and their ideas for the future","body":"<h2>Best player </h2> <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>John Terry. Captain, leader, legend. Fact. See also José Fonte.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>Eden Hazard, the player who consistently propelled Chelsea forward and was a constant source of opportunities and goals, with a bit more defensive responsibility thrown in.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Harry Kane and John Terry have strong claims. Eden Hazard, however, trumps both after thrilling in the first half of the season, during which he often seemed to be playing and thinking at twice the speed of his opponents, and then continuing to produce the goods when it mattered most to drive his team over the line.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>Eden Hazard has consistently been a delight to watch in a team who have not consistently been a delight to watch toweards the back end of the season. Still, he and they got the job done.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter</strong> John Terry. Not to belittle Eden Hazard’s claims on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/27/eden-hazard-chelsea-pfa-player-of-the-year\">Professional Footballers’ Association</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/12/eden-hazard-footballer-of-the-year\">Football Writers’ Association</a> awards by any means but Chelsea’s title win was built on the strongest defence in the division – and the veteran was the best component in it.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>Harry Kane. The most romantic, scarcely plausible individual storyline of the season. The boyhood Tottenham fan did not start a Premier League game until 9 November, which has served to cast his impact and numbers in an even more astonishing light. When he was rewarded with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/27/england-lithuania-european-championship-match-report\"> his England debut against Lithuania, he was obviously going to score after 78 seconds</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Harry Kane: 21 Premier League goals and an old-fashioned Boy’s Own story that this age of no surprises is supposed to prohibit. Can he keep it up? Tune in next season to find out.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>Guess it has to be Eden Hazard. Either that or the players and the football writers got it all wrong – could that be possible? Hazard is a joy to watch, a magical player. Harry Kane, however, deserves an honourable mention. Great to see a home-grown player making that sort of impact.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Heart says Esteban Cambiasso because of his exemplary influence in the Leicester fairytale. Head says Eden Hazard because he elevated the champions.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>David de Gea. Without him the modern Manchester United, arguably the biggest club in the world, would be in uncharted mid-table waters. And all the more fascinating for it: United’s 1970s travails were so much sexier than their 1960s successes. Though on that latter point, their supporters may understandably demur.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> Sergio Agüero. <strong>The Premier League’s top scorer </strong>and a consistently dazzling threat for the deposed champions. He also produced the two best individual displays I saw in the flesh this season: during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/09/qpr-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">City’s 2-2 draw with QPR in November</a> and in their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/03/manchester-city-problem-manuel-pellegrini-tottenham\">1-0 win at Tottenham</a> this month.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Harry Kane. Sergio Agüero may be the best striker in the Premier League but the Tottenham forward has to win this award. Who saw this season coming? Thirty-one club goals, 21 of them in the league, having started his first Premier League match for Spurs in April 2014. Remarkable.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Harry Kane. There are no genuinely outstanding outfield players in the Premier League this season. Eden Hazard has been the classiest but Kane gets my vote for his gloriously unexpected sense of verve and sustained goalscoring impact.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>Eden Hazard. He terrorised opposing right-backs, scored crucial goals during the run-in and assumed responsibility when Chelsea were in need of inspiration during tight matches. José Mourinho chided him at times last year but Hazard has responded brilliantly to the tough love and has blossomed into a player of authority and maturity this season. No one can accuse him of failing to make the most of his talent.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Harry Kane. Honorary mentions for Eden Hazard, John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and a few others but I expected that level of performance from them. Kane has taken the Premier League by surprise, scored 32 goals in all for club and country and won more points for his team than any other player.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>Harry Kane. The most thrilling young English centre-forward to have emerged since Alan Shearer.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>John Terry. Every minute of every game says it all. Eden Hazard has done the same and is easier on the eye but considering Terry’s age, experience and the fact he is still looked up to as an effective captain it is hard to see how anyone could have had a more impressive season.</p> <h2>Best manager </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b36df2264ea808f31e35e1c25806c504c36a8262\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432471237714/aa4a53b0-5db8-47a1-bed3-7ea9bc387812-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Pearson engineered an extraordinary late-season revival to keep Leicester City in the Premier League.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Pearson engineered an extraordinary late-season revival to keep Leicester City in the Premier League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>Nigel Pearson. Because he never succumbed to the fear and made his team fun to watch even when up to their necks in muck.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>José Mourinho, for getting his key transfer business done efficiently and early last summer though he only just edges out Ronald Koeman, Garry Monk and Nigel Pearson. Each surpassed expectations at his respective club.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Ronald Koeman. To put Southampton’s achievement into context it is necessary to rewind to last summer when they were a popular pick for the drop amid a mass exodus of players and endless scrutiny of the owner. To occupy the top six for most of the season was one thing. To do so with style and class, while integrating a host of new faces and bringing through yet another wave of young players was something else.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>Garry Monk’s achievements at Swansea have been quietly impressive, taking them to their highest Premier League points tally, despite losing a possible 16 of them from winning positions in the first half of the season, followed closely by his best striker. Monk also fathered twins and got married but seems to have coped heroically with the stress of it all, which would suggest his wife, Lexi, also deserves a tip of the hat.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter</strong> Ronald Koeman. Let’s be honest, most people outside Southampton predicted a relegation fight at St Mary’s back in August. Instead the Dutchman, in his first season in English football, constructed an outstanding defence, a potent attacking threat and kept Southampton in contention for European qualification until the final game of the season.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner</strong> José Mourinho. Sized things up last season and knew what he had to do to win it this time. Promptly made the necessary additions and did win it. Silverware is the ultimate currency for settling arguments.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Nigel Pearson. Leicester City were in the morgue, ready for burial on 3 April, rooted to the bottom on 19 points, seven from the last safe spot, with only nine matches remaining. Then, the sometimes controversial Pearson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/08/nigel-pearson-sacked-leicester-james-mcarthur-incident\">who was apparently sacked then reinstated in February</a>, somehow revived the side and fashioned a breathtaking run of six wins, a draw and a sole defeat from the next eight matches to make the Foxes safe before the season closed.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>Garry Monk. Eighth in the Premier League, in his first full season in management, with the seventh-smallest budget, did the double over Arsenal and Manchester United, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/14/wilfried-bony-manchester-city-swansea-ivory-coast\">sold his best player for £28m in January</a> and never acquired a replacement yet the team’s results got better – it’s a no-brainer.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Ronald Koeman. Walked into a supposed mess with a smile on his face, belief in his players, some shrewd signings and fresh ideas. He has managed all season as if sent to the south coast to spread happiness.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>Tim Sherwood. Does more right than he is given credit for and also is the first top-flight manager in a long while to recognise that football is nothing more than a big pantomime. His sense of joy is contagious, his brooding hot funks Brandoesque.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Ronald Koeman. I cannot be the only one who tipped Southampton to be flirting with relegation this season after they sold a string of their best players and lost their manager during the summer. It looked then that Koeman was walking into a tornado of trouble but he melded the club’s recruits with those who remained at St Mary’s to create a team who have outperformed the class of 2013-14, in league position and points total. An incredible achievement.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>José Mourinho. The obvious choice but the Portuguese has crafted another formidable side who could dominate the Premier League for years to come. Some strops along the way, of course, but Chelsea have been head and shoulders above their rivals. The signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fàbregas adapted quickly and Nemanja Matic has excelled. Other managerial shout-outs to Tony Pulis, Alan Pardew and Ronald Koeman.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Nigel Pearson, for the laughs and for having the last one himself.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>Honourable mentions to Garry Monk, Ronald Koeman and Nigel Pearson but it has to be José Mourinho. Arsène Wenger, Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini were no match for Chelsea’s trophy machine. To accuse Mourinho of boring football is irrelevant. The man knows how to win.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Ronald Koeman. Just think back to the insecurity that was polluting the air at Southampton last summer. Nobody could have imagined that until mid-February they would be in the Champions League places.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>Ronald Koeman. Made radical change seamless rather than intensely painful. An oasis of polite, measured, quietly amused calm in an often insane world. And Southampton play some lovely football, too.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>José Mourinho. The league table does not lie. Other managers have had memorable seasons – Garry Monk, Ronald Koeman, Alan Pardew and so on – but, if the task is simply to name the best manager in the Premier League, then the chap who has just made winning a third English title in five seasons look easy is ahead by quite a distance.</p> <h2>Best goal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49e846b236d7ce4c869707532616f8d077ebc573\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432471432807/9be2bcfc-14fe-46e3-ac3c-58367f7e67f3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Charlie Adam's goal for Stoke City at Chelsea from inside his own half was an outstanding moment of the season.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Adam’s goal for Stoke City at Chelsea from inside his own half was an outstanding moment of the season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>Charlie Adam. Because in an era of spreadsheets and chalkboards, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/04/chelsea-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">rocketing the ball into the opponents’ net from inside your own half</a> confirmed the comic book hero is king.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>The best I witnessed were Charlie Adam at Stamford Bridge and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/18/crystal-palace-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Cesc Fàbregas at Selhurst Park</a>, with a nod to the flash of skill from Yannick Bolasie in the build-up to Crystal Palace’s thrilling second against Liverpool last November.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Charlie Adam’s extraordinary strike for Stoke City from more than 60 yards at Stamford Bridge, narrowly over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/18/burnley-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea’s mesmerising team goal at Burnley</a> that was melded by Eden Hazard and Cesc Fàbregas and finished by André Schürrle.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>So many contenders, with quite a few scored on one remarkable early April weekend for “worldies”. As a fellow left-footer, Charlie Adam gets the nod for that 66-yard strike against Chelsea. Many players couldn’t kick the ball that far, let alone with such precision.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>Charlie Adam’s over Thibaut Courtois stands out but, selecting from games attended, it would have to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/27/liverpool-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Phil Jagielka’s 92nd-minute equaliser for Everton at Liverpool</a>. In terms of execution, timing and, in the context of a Merseyside derby, it was a Roy of the Rovers finish. And from a centre-half who started the season burdened by a poor World Cup but went on to enjoy a commanding campaign.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>Juan Mata’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/22/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">second goal for Manchester United versus Liverpool on 22 March</a>. This goal deserves the highest acclaim because it ticked every box, not least the one about producing on the grandest stage. Mata showed composure and technique to settle the biggest game in English football with a breathtaking scissor kick.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Juan Mata’s second at Anfield in Manchester United’s 2-1 win over Liverpool: a balletic scissor-kick that only the silkily smooth Spaniard could fashion.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>Charlie Adam’s goal at Chelsea was special but I’m going for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/04/west-bromwich-albion-queens-park-rangers-premier-league-match-report\">Bobby Zamora’s lob for QPR at West Bromwich Albion</a> earlier the same day. Zamora was running down the right-hand channel, outside the penalty area, and it looked as if he might, at best, swing over a cross with his right boot. Instead, he struck the ball with the outside of his left foot, without breaking his stride, and Boaz Myhill was left totally stranded as it sailed over his head.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Bobby Zamora versus West Brom. Improvised, delicate, a perfect arc. Perhaps even more surprising than Charlie Adam’s as it is not as if he tries the outrageous too often. What’s not to love?</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>George Boyd <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/28/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">for Burnley against Manchester City</a>. A pearler that continued one of English football’s most glorious traditions: relegation-bound teams giving reigning champions an almighty belt in the chops.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Bobby Zamora versus West Brom. Yes, I know, Charlie Adam scored from inside his own half but I’ve seen that before. What I haven’t seen before is a 34-year-old with a hip problem lobbing a goalkeeper from a ludicrously tight angle and with the outside of his foot. Joleon Lescott certainly didn’t see it coming as he ushered Zamora towards the corner flag after the forward had run on to a long upfield punt. Within seconds, however, the Albion centre-back was gawping in shock and awe, just like the rest of us.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Phil Jagielka v Liverpool. The classic centre-half bosh.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Bobby Zamora’s exhausted dink on the run against West Brom – because it was brilliant but you could still half-imagine being able to pull it off yourself some day at the 100th attempt.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>André Schürrle against Burnley on the opening day. The pass from Cesc Fàbregas told him where to go.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Ángel Di María, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/21/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United at Leicester</a>. The goal feels like a deception now bearing in mind we thought this would be the norm from Di María, not the exception, but there is always something exhilarating about the running, dinked chip.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>George Boyd <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/newcastle-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">for Burnley in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle on New Year’s Day</a>. After collecting a Danny Ings pass Boyd surged imperiously through the home defence before beating Jak Alnwick with a fabulous low shot.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>I’m going with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/05/sunderland-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">Jermain Defoe’s against Newcastle</a> because it was exciting, unexpected and perfectly executed. I realise you could say exactly the same about Charlie Adam’s wonder-strike against Chelsea, which was unarguably the most prodigious goal of the season, but this is not a precise science; it is whatever takes your fancy. There were people who thought Sunderland were wasting their money on Defoe, and I was one of them, so fair play. I don’t mind being proved wrong so elegantly.</p> <h2>Best match<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3fc163721448bfd29f29740a6b3a182cffe7cdc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432471746271/45f0de7e-9288-4195-af3c-73744e64de42-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Harry Kane scored two goals in Tottenham's 5-3 victory over Chelsea on New Year's Day.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Kane scored two goals in Tottenham’s 5-3 victory over Chelsea on New Year’s Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/30/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 3, Chelsea 6</a>.

Not too many teams score three goals against the champions and still end up on the wrong end of a hiding. Boring, boring Chelsea indeed.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>Everton 3, Chelsea 6. Only the third game of the season but, with the benefit of hindsight, it contained a weight of evidence as to why Chelsea would win the league and Everton would struggle. A breathless, end-to-end contest with mistakes, enthralling football and a bit of aggro thrown in. Only a stunning save from Thibaut Courtois prevented Kevin Mirallas making it 4-5 in the 81st minute. Only when Diego Costa punished another lapse in the 90th could Chelsea relax.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/21/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 5, Manchester United 3</a>. A metaphor for Leicester’s season. Seemingly down and out at the hands of the big boys, they produced a comeback to defy the odds and win the day at the death. The scenes after the fightback from 3-1 down will live long in the memory of those who were present.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>The Nigel Pearson-masterminded 5-3 victory over United for Leicester in September. The Reds were cruising at 3-1 up as the hour passed before four unanswered goals in 21 minutes produced a result Louis van Gaal continues to reference as his side’s poorest of the season.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>It would have to be Leicester City 5, Manchester United 3. A staggering game of football to watch, let alone report on and try to make sense of at the end. One statistic summed up why this was such an extraordinary afternoon: it was the first time in 853 Premier League matches United had surrendered a two-goal lead and lost. Come the end, Jamie Vardy was running United ragged and Ryan Giggs, sitting alongside Louis van Gaal, had one hand covering his eyes.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Am I allowed at least to mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/21/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 2, Bradford 4 in the FA Cup</a>? Not in the rules? OK then, how about Leicester 5, Manchester United 3. It was a gawp or fall on the floor or jump-about-in-astonishment game to watch.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>Everton 3, Chelsea 6. A rout. Sort of. It was jaw-dropping, one-sided nonsense, apart from the 20-minute period during which Everton enjoyed 73% possession and nearly completed an astonishing comeback. That’s tedious Chelsea for you.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Leicester 5, Manchester United 3. When Leonardo Ulloa struck his penalty past David de Gea on 83 minutes, it felt as if the earth had shaken. This type of thing simply did not happen to Manchester United, even during the darkest of David Moyes days, but here it was – a 3-1 lead blown to bits through a combination of United’s naive defending and Leicester’s never-say-die swagger. They’ll be talking about it in the east Midlands for years.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Tottenham 5, Chelsea 3. This dramatic game almost got lost amid the Christmas binge but it was a stunning result. Inspired by Harry Kane, Tottenham were rampant and Chelsea’s defence looked lost on a wild evening at White Hart Lane. Mourinho’s side responded well but for a moment their vulnerabilities on display here livened up the title race.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Leicester City 5, Manchester United 3. Nuts. Fun. And, ultimately, significant for both teams.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/07/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Arsenal</a>. The day that Kane-mania reached fever pitch.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Everton 3, Chelsea 6. A wild, bad-tempered and brilliantly eccentric game, with a result that felt like a throwback to the days when football was watched in black and white.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/06/newcastle-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Newcastle 2, Chelsea 1</a> in December. Papiss Cissé scored twice as Alan Pardew’s then side ended Chelsea’s 23-match unbeaten run. Those were the days.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>I don’t think there were many outstanding games. Leicester 5, Manchester United 3 is the one that sticks in the memory, although it would be pushing it to describe it as the best of anything. Everton 3, Chelsea 6 was also a remarkable afternoon.</p> <h2>Best referee<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd54c4730cef6bfc095380c77107834e543825c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432471911292/a096ebb9-b4f1-498c-ab7c-92786f247462-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Clattenburg gets plenty of votes as the Premier League's best referee from 2014-15.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Clattenburg gets plenty of votes as the Premier League’s best referee from 2014-15.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>Martin Atkinson. Unfussy manner, generally good decisions, accurate pointer, textbook whistle action.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>Mark Clattenburg appears to offer players the best explanation for his decisions. Michael Oliver’s reputation grows but it has not been a great year for referees.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Mark Clattenburg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/29/referee-mark-clattenburg-dropped-ed-sheeran\">may have an unforgivable penchant for Ed Sheeran</a> and should drop his chummy act with some players, but he gets most of the big decisions right. For a referee, that’s pretty much the only yardstick.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>John Terry.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>Mark Clattenburg, which says it all about the standard of refereeing this season.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>Michael Oliver. Brave and generally sound.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Michael Oliver, although as most men in black seem to lack feeling for the game, can former players please be encouraged to take up the whistle.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>Not Lee Mason, there’s a start. I like Mark Clattenburg: he gets some stick – don’t they all – but I think he’s a decent official, not easily swayed by supporters and seems to have a reasonable rapport with the players. Should be refereeing the FA Cup final but somebody on high doesn’t like him.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Michael Oliver. It is perhaps not the most competitive field it has ever been in the refereeing department but his generally sharp eye and calm authority work well.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>Mark Clattenburg, who manages to annoy managers, players, fans and his own bosses in equal measure. Marvellous. Good on him. Just think how boring it would be if referees were always right.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Michael Oliver. I don’t have a particularly strong view on this category but will go for Oliver because of his age. Not original, I know, but it remains some achievement to be one of the leading and most consistent officials in the Premier League at 30.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Mark Clattenburg. The others weren’t great.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>None. Talking about referees is to be discouraged. May as well ask for best corner flag or best goalpost.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>A season of baffling refereeing decisions approached peak satire with Mark Clattenburg’s Ed Sheeran fiasco.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Mark Clattenburg. Michael Oliver and Mike Dean have been reasonable, too. Let’s not go overboard, though, it hasn’t been a season of distinction for the Premier League referees.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>Mark Clattenburg. At least the north-east had one Premier League success story this season.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>I honestly haven’t a clue. I don’t go to football matches to watch referees, I’m not an assessor. I can never even remember which ones have made mistakes or sent the wrong person off; they are all interchangeable to me. Generally I think officials do an excellent job in difficult circumstances but otherwise I find the subject boring, so I’m guessing Mark Clattenburg would be a safe choice.</p> <h2>Best signing <br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae5f6f182015a7c5e5504679d488593724b03580\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432472129292/f795fe54-5c41-44de-8a71-51317acbb9c0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alexis Sánchez has proved well worth the £30m Arsenal paid to buy him from Barcelona.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Sánchez has proved well worth the £30m Arsenal paid to buy him from Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>Sadio Mané. All the pre-season talk was of the players who left Southampton but the Senegalese <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/29/senegal-little-diamond-sadio-mane-southampton\">helped shift the focus back on to the arrivals and got better as the season progressed</a>. Honourable mention to Esteban Cambiasso.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>For the sheer impact they have had on the champions and particularly over their blistering start to the campaign, Cesc Fàbregas and Diego Costa at Chelsea.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Diego Costa. Mourinho knew exactly who he wanted last summer and Costa’s bullying, battering-ram approach – allied to no little skill – set the tone for Chelsea’s dominance. He was the focal point Chelsea had been lacking since Didier Drogba was in his pomp and, if the latter part of his season was disrupted by injury and suspension, he had done more than enough to justify a £32m fee that already looks a snip.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>Diego Costa to Chelsea. Twenty league goals and 12 yellow cards was an excellent return from a snarling menace who never looked entirely at peace with his own notoriously taut hamstrings.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>Diego Costa. Paying a shed-load for a leading striker in European football has not guaranteed Chelsea success in the past, beyond Didier Drogba, obviously, but Costa’s seamless transition into the Premier League, his goals, work-rate and aggression announced José Mourinho’s team as champions-in-waiting from the start. Special mention too for Esteban Cambiasso.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>Alexis Sánchez. Has faded a little over the second-half of the season but his pulse-quickening performances over the first half of it set a high benchmark and were a joy to watch. South Americans are not supposed to settle this quickly. His style is tailor-made for English football.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Cesc Fàbregas. Creates goals, scores goals, runs the midfield and games.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>Struggled with this category at the start of the season and it’s some form of consolation that it’s still difficult now. Cesc Fàbregas, Alexis Sánchez and Diego Costa have claims, as does Lukasz Fabianski, who joined Swansea on a free. Taking value for money into the equation as well, Fabianski, who virtually swept the board at Swansea’s end-of-season awards, gets the nod.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Esteban Cambiasso. Just came out of left field, a veteran with River Plate, Real Madrid and Internazionale on his CV rocking up to play with Wes Morgan and Jamie Vardy. Totally inspired free transfer. Even the injured Leicester players came out to train on the day he arrived just to see him. A wonderful contribution for Leicester this season.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>Diego Costa. With Luis Suárez gone, the Premier League desperately needed another brilliant cartoon villain. One strongly suspects Sky fingering Costa for “crimes” gave José Mourinho a warm glow in the tummy.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Esteban Cambiasso. When Leicester announced they had signed the former Argentina midfielder on a free transfer the immediate suspicion was that he was moving to the club purely for a final, easy-does-it pay day. Instead, the Champions League-winning 34-year-old has proved an inspiring and important influence on a side who have just completed one of the most incredible survival acts in Premier League history. Not surprisingly, he was voted Leicester’s player of the season.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Alexis Sánchez. Forget needing a season to settle in England. Sánchez hit the ground running at Arsenal and has been worth every penny of his £30m fee. Twenty-four goals in all competitions and eight league assists in a debut campaign full of buzz and brilliance – without him Arsenal would have struggled.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Cesc Fàbregas slotted right in and made all the goals Chelsea asked for. Although faded as always and at times poses as many structural questions as he answers.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>Chelsea needed a top striker. Diego Costa is a top striker. Chelsea bought Diego Costa. Chelsea won the league. Arsenal could learn from their proactivity in the transfer market this summer.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Diego Costa. The player Chelsea were missing last season. He and Cesc Fàbregas have taken José Mourinho’s team to the next level.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>Esteban Cambiasso, even if Sunderland’s Lee Cattermole did eclipse him last week. Proof there really can be top-class value in the free-transfer market.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>Not Ángel Di María, obviously. Diego Costa was a much better fit with Premier League requirements, even if his season tailed off through injury and suspension. Marouane Fellaini did well, too. Strictly speaking he was signed last season but this time a year ago he was everybody’s flop, so that is quite a turnaround.</p> <h2>Worst flop<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d59809180ec3174086cc2de989e666f5551113ad\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432472214907/e387ff77-0f70-4e52-b061-b8d5143ef0ed-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Radamel Falcao failed to live up to expectations at Manchester United after joining on loan from Monaco.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radamel Falcao failed to live up to expectations at Manchester United after joining on loan from Monaco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>Vincent Kompany. The statesmanlike demeanour does not wash when City’s defence is so anarchic. Dishonourable mention to Harry Redknapp.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>Close-run thing between Mike Ashley’s Newcastle United and Manchester City’s recruitment department.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Tight contest between Manchester United’s big-money South Americans Radamel Falcao and Ángel Di María. The Colombian just edges it, his time at Old Trafford fizzling out in a flurry of niggles and frustrating missed opportunities as it became clear that injury had vastly diminished a striker who once struck fear into the heart of opponents. At least Di María may get the chance to redeem himself next season.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>Juan Cuadrado’s move from Fiorentina to Chelsea hasn’t worked out too well but it’s early days. If only they could have got their hands on Kevin de Bruyne, André Schürrle or Mohamed Salah instead, eh?</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>John Carver. Put into an invidious position in keeping with Mike Ashley’s running of Newcastle but even that, and his brief time in the job, does not excuse the car crash that has followed on Tyneside. Mario Balotelli does not qualify in this category as no one expected him to succeed at Liverpool. Not even Brendan Rodgers, a few weeks before spending £16m on him.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>Radamel Falcao. Arrived with a towering reputation but has frequently looked lost. When he has pressed on the accelerator, there has been nothing there. The real frustration for Manchester United fans will surely come when he rediscovers his explosive game elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Radamel Falcao. The galáctico’s galáctico had a season in hell and though it would be heartening to see a return to his former brilliance at United next term he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/24/radamel-falcao-manchester-united-told-he-can-leave-louis-van-gaal\">has been told he can leave</a>.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>Got to be a few Manchester United and Liverpool players in this category. Mario Balotelli has been a waste of space but then many suspected that would be the case. Ángel Di María would go down as a big disappointment at the moment and that was not the Radamel Falcao I had pictured playing here and terrorising central defenders.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Ahmed Elmohamady’s comedy dive against Arsenal was a flop and a half.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>Adam Lallana. That rare thing: a two-footed English player. And very little end product from either set of expensive twinkletoes. Technical ability is not the be all and end all.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Liverpool’s transfer committee. We won’t do a Tottenham, they insisted, after Luis Suárez was sold to Barcelona for £75m, yet ultimately that is what has come to pass: a world-class, game-changing talent departs and in his place arrives a group of players who have come nowhere near filling the quality void. Emre Can looks a decent buy and Rickie Lambert at £4m can be written off easily enough, but spending £20m on Dejan Lovren and Lazar Markovic, £25m on Adam Lallana and £16m on Mario Balotelli has proved a disastrous use of funds at a stage when Liverpool had the opportunity to attract Champions League-quality players. The committee, which includes the manager, Brendan Rodgers, have questions to answer, as does the entire hierarchy at the club.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Mario Balotelli. A dreadful signing for Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers took a £16m punt and it backfired.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Radamel Falcao. Oh dear. Come here. Come on. Let’s have a hug.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>It is a good job that Liverpool put all that effort into signing Dejan Lovren.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>Mario Balotelli. The most predictable one, too. You know he will let you down, and you just have to try to get something out of him in the better times. In Liverpool’s case they have not got near.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>It hast to be John Carver but he has been hung out to dry. Mike Ashley is the man to blame. Player-wise: Mario Balotelli.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>The north-east as a seething, passionate hotbed of football. Another dire season all round in the Premier League, <strong>Middlesbrough’s solid Championship campaign</strong> amounting to the only reason to be cheerful. Even Hull, merely through being adjacent on the east Yorkshire coast, seem to have caught the malaise from Newcastle and Sunderland.

Forget the younger, tactically aware pretenders. Souness is still the boss. At this best when struggling to contain the seething anger.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Gary Neville. Continues to be worth a listen whenever he speaks.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James</strong> Not something I feel strongly about. Gary Neville or Jamie Carragher. Oh, and Danny Murphy is OK. Alan Shearer would not be near the top of my list by any stretch (just want to be clear on that) but he has improved.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Shared between Sky’s excellent double act of Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher. They can debate over who gets to keep it first.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>Robbie Savage. Back in the day, summarisers interjected once every 15 to 30 minutes with a nugget of measured analysis. The pendulum can swing no further in the opposite direction than Savage’s abject, content-free, Commodore-64-on-Novaload screech when Arsenal visited Brighton in the Cup. The laws of physics state the pendulum must now start swinging back. Savage has, therefore, served a crucial purpose, and for that we should all be thankful.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Jamie Carragher. The former Liverpool centre-back has grown into his role with Sky and formed a very watchable, insightful partnership with Gary Neville on Monday Night Football. A mention, too, for Terry Gibson, who is a brilliantly informed and articulate member of Sky’s Spanish football team.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Gary Neville and Sky’s Monday Night Football remains the best place for analysis and debate. The arrival of Jermaine Jenas on the BBC has also been refreshing.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Jermaine Jenas, who does not really talk like a pundit, or even seem to realise he is on television at all, but just sounds like someone talking vaguely about football while waiting for a lift to arrive or queueing up for a sandwich.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>Jermaine Jenas has been excellent on Match of the Day, Alan Shearer has improved massively, Graeme Souness’s rancour is great on Sky on Champions League nights, Thierry Henry has shown he is not afraid to criticise Arsenal and Jamie Carragher is intelligent and passionate. But let’s face it, it is not really a contest. Gary Neville.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor</strong> Gary Neville. Firmly established now as the doyen of the industry. Sky’s team – most notably Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness – are so much stronger than their counterparts elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>David Pleat. Car journeys are always so much more enjoyable and informative when he is on the radio.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>Graeme Souness is pretty good, all the better for not having to worry any more about criticising individuals he may later find himself having to manage. I like the sound of Kevin Kilbane and Jermaine Jenas, both articulate and engaging, and I will sort of miss Andy Townsend, who may only have pointed out the bleedin’ obvious but managed to do so without being irritating, which is not a skill many commentators possess.</p> <h2>Biggest gripe<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dccda7fe60a6766794c8faf8fb1334f416b34981\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432473880782/03f19078-1405-4397-87fe-76dd44dc3f8b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Arsenal fans are among those who have protested against high ticket prices.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal fans are among those who have protested against high ticket prices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>The ubiquity of bookies.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>Back to Mike Ashley and the despair he is spreading around Tyneside. Where is the hope? Where is the ambition? What is the point?</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>Ticket prices. Still. To point to full stadiums is no longer enough in light of the looming £8bn megabucks TV deal. The leagues and clubs must do more to address the make-up of that crowd, make things easier for away fans, encourage the next generation and prevent football becoming a luxury product.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>While often amusing, the sight and sound of tinfoil hat-wearing managers, players or supporters working themselves into a self-righteous, mouth-foaming funk over some minor or imaginary slight against their team is getting increasingly tedious.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>Attending press conferences where the positive words emanating from the manager’s mouth bear no relation to the mediocre football everyone else has just witnessed.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>The shameless and relentless way that bookmakers offer odds on non-issues in the quest for promotion. How do I get off the mailing lists?</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>The ease with which yellow cards can be shown.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>I really wish this category wasn’t confined to work/football. Anyway, the usual things annoy me: diving and play-acting. Beyond that, people banging on about the importance of stability and citing what Fergie achieved at United in the same breath, as if every manager would turn into the Scot and have the same level of success if he was in a job long enough. Yes, clubs can be too quick at times to ditch a manager but, if Villa had stayed loyal to Paul Lambert, they would probably be playing in the Championship next season. Ditto Crystal Palace with Neil Warnock.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Premier League ticket prices. Twenty’s plenty for all away fans is overdue.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>People keep griping about things.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>Half-and-half scarves. Yes, they’re mainly for tourists looking to mark their first time at a Premier League game but I don’t care where people are from or how harmless their intentions, everyone should know that certain clubs do not belong together on neck-warming pieces of fabric. Quite frankly, anyone caught at Old Trafford with a Man Utd-Man City scarf, at Anfield with a Liverpool-Chelsea scarf or at the Emirates with an Arsenal-Tottenham scarf should be banned from attending a football match ever again.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Bad decisions and their fall-out. Some of the refereeing decisions this season have beggared belief. Statistics produced by Professional Game Match Officials Limited state that more decisions are correct now than ever before, yet referees have got a number of the big calls wrong. Things need to improve but the regular recriminations and fall-out on Monday mornings after a controversial weekend have been tedious. Former referees throwing their weight around have not helped.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Everybody having so many gripes.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>Mike Ashley’s unique charm.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>José Mourinho’s conspiracy theories. Such a brilliant and charismatic manager but also so tiresome with his insistence on seeing an agenda through the prism of – well, whaddya know – his own agenda. Mourinho says everyone has it in for Chelsea. We don’t, José, and you probably know that deep down.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>The appalling lack of access to players at Newcastle United and Sunderland.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>Same as last season: stupid kick-off times and inconsiderate scheduling of matches. Especially when the price of tickets is so high.</p> <h2>Change for next season<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19180556eb148eae9bb58cdea488041719e3f302\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432472466481/aa5ed524-0e3b-4c67-b520-4f222cdc8982-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Ashley's running of Newcastle United has earned him significant criticism.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Ashley’s running of Newcastle United has earned him significant criticism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Heppell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Paul Doyle </strong>Ban pimping. This business of buying players just to rent them out must be stopped. If a player does not start at least, say, five matches for his club, he should be allowed leave for free at the end of the season (if he wants to).</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield </strong>That daft rule that sees players needing minor treatment having to leave the field, often while their team defend a set piece – remember Michael Dawson against Burnley – needs to change.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson </strong>More in hope than expectation but it is to be hoped that the new sports minister, Tracey Crouch, makes reform of football’s outmoded structures a priority and works with the FA and the Premier League to address the crisis facing grassroots facilities.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>A maximum price of £20 for away tickets, as championed tirelessly by the <a href=\"http://fsf.org.uk/campaigns/away-fans/score-campaign-twentys-plenty-for-away-tickets/\">Football Supporters’ Federation</a>. Clubs can easily afford the hit and it would be a nice gesture of goodwill towards the extras who often help make their productions so compelling. The enforcement of stricter rules and regulations to protect the welfare of players suffering from bangs to the head and possible concussions would also be nice.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter </strong>The Football Supporters’ Federation’s “Twenty is Plenty” campaign for tickets to away matches being adopted by every Premier League club. Meanwhile, in another world …</p> <p><strong>David Hytner </strong>Introduce no-fly zones over stadiums to prevent whodunnit banner warfare.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson </strong>Can managers stop moaning about international call-ups/the busy festive period? It is the same for you all.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James </strong>First, if you’re going to MLS, you must clear off within a week of making the decision, so as to avoid general confusion and protracted farewells (a couple of players in mind there, in case you were wondering). Second, I’m not a Newcastle fan but please sell up, Mike Ashley. You are draining the life out of that football club. Third, the top four positions at the end of the season are not filled with the four clubs with the highest turnover (dreamland on that one).</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence </strong>Accelerated trials to see how the Premier League can offer more video assistance to referees. Let’s help them to get more key decisions right.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>A wage cap, a ban on shirt sponsors, the implementation of safe standing, transfer windows to be replaced by an old-school, late-season deadline, clubs restricted to two loan deals (in and out) all season, free entry to under-16s, pints by the pitch, and free pies. This asking too much?</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong>More affordable ticket prices. Far too many people are being priced out of watching the club they love, which is particularly galling when billions upon billions are pouring into the Premier League through television and commercial deals. An increasing number of supporters are taking a stand – seen starkly when a large group of Liverpool fans boycotted their team’s match at Hull in April because of the cost of the away tickets – and it is about time the relevant authorities took more notice of them.</p> <p><strong>James Riach </strong>Chelsea to start on -10 points to make it interesting.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay </strong>Four teams to be relegated, with the last Premier League space decided by a six-team, inter-divisional play-off featuring the Championship and the Scottish title winners.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong>How about experimenting with extra officials behind the goals? As long as everyone agrees not to ask what they do.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor </strong>OK, it is more of a 2016 issue but the idea of Friday night matches is another poke in the eye to the dwindling numbers of us who value football’s traditions (and while we’re at it, a 3pm kick-off for the FA Cup final may be welcome, too.)</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor </strong>For all Premier League clubs to develop and fund their own women’s team and offer them the sort of facilities Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal provide for their excellent female sides.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson </strong>I would like to see Thursday night football abolished. David Cameron ought to use his new majority to make it illegal in this country. So then Uefa could either move the day of their Europa League games or go ahead without English involvement. No one would really mind. Most English clubs would love an official sicknote.</p>","linkText":"Premier League 2014-15 review: Our writers’ best and worst","lastModified":1433002722000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"Our writers name their player of the season, the best goal, the best match, the worst flops and their ideas for the future","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4976x","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"football/series/premier-league-2014-15-review-of-the-season","url":"/football/series/premier-league-2014-15-review-of-the-season","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Premier League 2014-15 review of the season","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/premier-league-2014-15-review-of-the-season","description":"Welcome to theguardian.com’s review of the 2014-15 Premier League season.

America got a war it wanted - even if it wasn’t what it expected","body":"<p>A couple of weeks ago, the Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/11/jeb-bush-i-would-have-invaded-iraq\" title=\"\">was asked</a> in an interview with Fox News whether, knowing what he knows now, he would have invaded Iraq. It’s the kind of predictable question for which most people assumed he would have a coherent answer. They were wrong. Jeb blew it. “I would have [authorised the invasion],” he said. “And so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got.”</p> <p>For the next few days, as he was hammered from left and right, he flailed around like a four-star general in search of a plausible exit strategy. In a number of do-overs, he answered the same question with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/on-iraq-question-jeb-bush-stumbles-and-his-gop-rivals-pounce/2015/05/13/05dccac4-f97c-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html\" title=\"\">“I don’t know”</a>, “I didn’t understand the question”, and “no” before finally falling back on the perennial Republican default of <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/jeb-bush-iraq-obama-fault-118171.html\" title=\"\">blaming everything on Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>“You can tell a true war story by the way it never seems to end. Not then, not ever,” writes Tim O’Brien in his novel about Vietnam, The Things They Carried. “In a true war story, if there’s a moral at all, it’s like the thread that makes the cloth. You can’t tease it out. You can’t extract the meaning without unravelling the deeper meaning.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/14/jeb-bush-decides-i-would-not-have-gone-into-iraq\">Jeb Bush backtracks again: 'I would not have gone into Iraq'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iraq is one such story. The troops may have left, but the fallout from the conflict lingers in the American polity, clinging to its elites like stale cigarette smoke to an Aran sweater – it stinks, and they just can’t shake it. Not only did it trip Jeb up, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/15/comment.usa\" title=\"\">remains the abiding, shameful legacy of his brother George Bush’s administration.</a> And, as Jeb hinted, it dogged Clinton during her 2008 presidential bid, too.</p> <p>Back then, she <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-iraq-war-vote-mistake-iowa-118109.html\" title=\"\">claimed</a> if she’d known what George Bush would do with the authority to go to war (ie go to war with it) she would never have given it to him. That didn’t fly. Now she concedes her vote was an unqualified “mistake”.</p> <p>Extracting a moral from this disaster would demand “unravelling the deeper meaning” of America’s military impulses, the popular consent it enjoys and the craven political assent it is accorded.</p> <p>It would require an assessment of why so many Americans supported the war for so long, how an ostensibly independent media not only failed to challenge the state but <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/forget-what-we-know-now-we-knew-then-the-iraq-war-was-a-joke-20150518?page=1\" title=\"\">actively capitulated</a> to it, and why nobody has paid the price for any of these mistakes. In short, it would demand a reckoning with American power – how it works, as well as whom it works for, and to what end. (Britain’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/04/poison-iraq-labour-admit-mistake\" title=\"\">pathetic collusion</a> demands a whole other column.)</p> <p>In the absence of such an account, a true war story is not possible, and so the political class would rather collude in a huge lie that will continue to infect the US body politic, as Vietnam did, until it finds remedy in the truth.</p> <p>The point here is not to relitigate the war. The verdict on that front is clear by the number of those who once endorsed it and now disclaim it. The point is to reclaim the truth of the past in the hope of a better and more honest future. If those who lied us into the war can lie us out of it too, then we are no better equipped to stop them the next time.</p> <p>Jeb’s mistake is that he picked the wrong lie. It’s simply not true that “almost everybody” who saw the intelligence backed the war – <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution#United_States_House_of_Representatives\" title=\"\">133 representatives and 23 senators opposed it</a>. Nonetheless, his rationale – worthy of any hapless teenager – that he would have done it because everybody else was doing it has more integrity than most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/13/jeb-bush-iraq-war-fox-news-george-w-bush-liability\">Jeb Bush's Iraq war fumble lays bare the political football that is George W Bush</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of those who supported it did so in an act of cowardly political calculation. Raising their index finger to the political wind and the middle finger to international law they thought: “This is going to happen, so I might as well get on board.”</p> <p>Opposing the war in 2003 struck those with more ambition than principle as a career-ending act of folly. The administration was selling lies; but they were willing buyers.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, the public was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/18/us-blind-price-paid-iraqis\" title=\"\">of the same mindset</a>. The most important single factor shaping Americans’ opinions about any war is not American casualties, foreign casualties or even expense, but whether they think America will win, says Christopher Gelpi, a political science professor at Duke University who specialises in public attitudes to US foreign policy. Sure enough, on the eve of the invasion <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/7990/public-support-iraq-invasion-inches-upward.aspx\" title=\"\">two thirds</a> of Americans backed it and a slim majority said they’d supported it without a UN resolution. Support grew once the bombing started and only soured once it was clear no victory was in sight.</p> <p>The falsehood peddled by most of Jeb’s critics <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/18/politics/rick-perry-iraq-war-election-2016/\" title=\"\">amounts to this</a>: “I wouldn’t support it now because now we know the intelligence was faulty. But there’s no way we could have known that then.” Or as New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/05/19/david_brooks_sickening_iraq_apologia_how_the_new_york_times_hack_just_rewrote_history/\" title=\"\">most eminent stenographers for American state power</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/opinion/david-brooks-learning-from-mistakes.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">put it</a>: “To erase mistakes from the past is to obliterate your world now. You can’t go back and know then what you know now.”</p> <p>The trouble with this is that we did know then. The world knew, which is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/10/foreignpolicy.iraq\" title=\"\">majorities in almost every other country opposed it</a>. The United Nations was trying to acquire proof one way or another but was not allowed to finish the job. Politicians were not, in fact, led to war by faulty intelligence; they <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/opinion/paul-krugman-errors-and-lies.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">deliberately commissioned</a> the intelligence that would enable them to go to war.</p> <p>According to notes taken by Steve Cambone, aide to the former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, just hours after the 9/11 attack Rumsfeld <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/building-momentum-regime-change-rumsfe\" title=\"\">demanded</a>: the “best info fast ... judge whether good enough [to] hit S.H.

According to a new report from the UN security council, more than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/islamist-fighters-drawn-from-half-the-worlds-countries-says-un\">25,000 foreign fighters</a> are taking part in jihadi conflicts, with more and more joining in recent months. They come from more than 100 countries, meaning that half the countries in the world are providing volunteers for groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida. If the fighting currently raging in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> cannot then be defined as an international, or at least internationalised conflict, it is hard to know what is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/islamist-fighters-drawn-from-half-the-worlds-countries-says-un\">Islamist fighters drawn from half the world's countries, says UN</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The international perspective includes not only the composition of the fighting groups, but the perceived risk if and when these ideologically committed and battle-hardened individuals decide to go home. The UN report notes that they pose “an immediate and long-term threat”, giving credence – if any were needed – to the long-standing fears of western intelligence services – including MI5 and MI6 – that returning fighters from Syria and Iraq could bring back with them not only a world view inimical to the country whose nationality they bear, but the military training to act in pursuit of their anti-western aims.</p> <p>The report will only increase the pressure on western leaders, starting with Barack Obama, to take more aggressive measures against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Isis</a> and other jihadi groups, in the name of both national and international security. The fall of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/17/iraqi-prime-minister-defence-anbar-isis-attacks\">Iraqi city of Ramadi to Isis forces</a> earlier this month, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/21/isis-palmyra-syria-islamic-state\">Isis flag now flying above the emblematic Syrian fortress at Palmyra</a>, together precipitated an outpouring of criticism against Obama for passivity while western civilisation burned. His US critics claimed that the US policy of air strikes, in alliance with the Gulf states and others, had been proved to be ineffective. There was now no alternative, they argued, to putting at least some American boots on the ground. Obama’s attempt at war by remote-control had failed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama has continued to defend his policy of air strikes only, despite recent Isis victories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the UK, David Cameron came in for some of the same criticism at the weekend from, among others, the former head of the army, Lord Dannatt, who claimed that air strikes alone could not do the job. He denied that he was any sort of “gung-ho” general, but called for a parliamentary debate <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/former-army-head-calls-for-british-troops-to-fight-is-1-3782306\">on the dispatch of 5,000 British troops</a>.</p> <p>Almost more telling than the criticism – mainly, but not exclusively, from former military men – on both sides of the Atlantic, has been the non-response from political leaders. Obama has continued to defend his policy of air strikes only, despite recent Isis victories – most recently in an interview in Atlantic magazine, while Cameron lost no time in quashing Lord Dannatt’s suggestion via his new business secretary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32864321\">Sajid Javid, who said that Syria and Iraq</a> were not wars on the ground for British troops.</p> <p>Both Obama and Cameron are right. There is no public appetite in either country for new military engagements in the wider Middle East. Past failures are too fresh in the public memory. More to the point, however, is the likely success – or otherwise – of any western military escalation. The US defence secretary, Ash Carter, said after the fall of Ramadi that Iraqi troops had shown no will to fight.</p> <p>He may have been too hasty in his judgment; a counter-attack is said to be envisaged. But if the army of Iraq or the variegated rebels in Syria lack the will to win, there is no reason for western forces to support them in a fight they will be unable to sustain.

The platforms usually lay responsibility for this at the feet of their users, and, ultimately, they’re right that nobody is to blame for hate speech but the speakers themselves. But do online platforms also have a responsibility for some kind of oversight and moderation? Is a place like Twitter (to choose an obviously successful and public platform) blameless if someone uses it for evil, or does it have a right – and a duty – to put its foot down?</p><p>It comes down to whether online platforms are tools for writing, or more like publications. Nobody blames Microsoft Word if someone uses it to write a threatening letter. But if the New York Times published an opinion piece calling for genocide, there would rightfully be an outcry.
