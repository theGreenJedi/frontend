What is this trend for dramatic one-word titles that don’t really mean anything all about?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>On a recent trip to my local bookstore, I couldn’t help but notice that the young adult shelves are becoming increasingly populated by books with slightly obscure single-word titles: Divergent, Slated, Delirium, Cinder, Angelfire (this one is two words smooshed together into a one word title!). The titles began to blur together as I started to wonder, what has happened to original book naming? </p> <p>I don’t want to criticise any of these books for their title alone, many of those I reference in this article are books I haven’t read so I’m not judging the content at all, but why do so many YA books have to succumb to this trend? Wouldn’t it be better to make your book stand out by giving it a more memorable title which didn’t seem like it was lifted from a dictionary of unusual words in a desperate attempt to sound unique? I love interesting words as much as the next person and I love to use them in stories but when I look at a shelf full of these single-word titles I find them rather formulaic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/20/trendy-following-the-crowd-teen-books\">'Trendy' books: should we really be following the crowd?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there are the not-so-unique single-word titles, the ones that don’t even try to be unusual. They sometimes end in -ed and, much as I hate to admit being so judgemental, they are an easy way to make sure I never even pick up the book. Matched, Switched, Fallen, Uglies (or its sequels Pretties, Extras and Specials)... All potentially brilliant books but the titles are enough to send me to sleep. Maybe the one-word title was simple and effective when Jane Austen wrote Persuasion but now there’s nothing like one of these titles to make your book seem like “just another teen novel”, regardless of what an amazing story you may have written.</p> <p>To make matters worse, all these books seem to have endless sequels, with increasingly nonsensical titles in an attempt to make them match. Why do they have to match?! The matching title trend is driving me to distraction! Divergent fans may hate me for saying this, but for me, rhyming series titles are equivalent to naming your twins Ronald and Donald! </p> <p>Unwind, UnStrung, UnWholly, UnSouled, UnDivided, UnBound... Surely this is taking the matching title trend a step too far. Those mid-word capital letters aren’t doing anything for me either. UnSouled isn’t even a real word – perhaps there ought to be a companion volume called “UnGrammatical”!</p> <p>Not all of these matching series titles are single-word of course: Shatter Me, Unravel Me, Ignite Me, Destroy Me and Fracture Me made me cringe almost as much as Matched, Crossed and Reached (Reached? As in I “reached” for the only book on the shelf with an original title only to find it had two sequels that rhymed?) Then there’s Slated, Shattered and Fractured – sound familiar?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/14/only-in-ya-teen-books\">Only in YA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I don’t want to stop anyone enjoying these books or deny that many of these are popular novels with many devoted readers. Perhaps this is just a pet peeve of mine but I can’t help sighing with relief when I find a series that doesn’t feel the need to prove that the books belong together by making them sound the same. Fortunately for me, there are noble exceptions to this trend: the Miss Peregrine’s Peculiar Children trilogy and the Chaos Walking trilogy to name a couple. No doubt “don’t judge a book by its title” will be the resounding roar, just don’t expect me to be picking up The Selection any time soon (or its sequels The Elite, The One, The Heir, The Crown and on and on and on........)</p> <h2><strong>Are you burning with desire to express your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/series/teen-opinion\">teen opinion</a> on a book-related subject? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site here if you’re a keen reader and not already a member!</a></strong></h2>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4g789","wordcount":"643","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/86ffa16610bf47194c2b865482f10e5d40a83127/0_154_2187_1312/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>It’s hard not to judge a book by its title when they’re all so unimaginative, says <strong>site member Valentine</strong>.

Compared to Europe, his homeland seemed a place of absences: “no country gentlemen, no palaces, nor manors, nor old country houses … no great universities nor public schools.” James’s lack of patriotism was condemned at the time, and his remarks may seem snobbish and old-fashioned, but he does have a point. Novelists need something to get their teeth into, and what they most often bite down on is culture. Without culture, in the broad sense of that word, what is there left for a novelist to write about? It’s as reasonable a question now, I think, as it was in 1879, and it’s certainly a question faced by anyone thinking of setting a novel above the Arctic Circle (a place where, even its fondest champions would have to confess, country gentlemen and great public schools tend to be few and far between). </p> <p>The Arctic, as it is imagined by most novelists on this list, is a place at the edge of, or beyond, culture. But this, despite James’s warning, doesn’t mean it is without potential as a literary setting. It just means that it encourages, or allows, a particular kind of writing – a writing more concerned with extremes and limit cases than with the subtle details of social interaction. The high Arctic becomes a version of the heath in Shakespeare’s King Lear: the place where the superficial and inessential is stripped away, and we are left with something much more raw and basic. </p> <p>That’s certainly how I came to think about the Arctic as setting when I was writing my latest novel The North Water, a book about a murderer on a 19th-century Arctic whaling ship. The story is set in and around Baffin Bay, the stretch of sea and ice between east coast of Canada and the west coast of Greenland, and by placing my characters in that extraordinarily harsh and empty landscape in winter I was able to explore one of the questions that first provoked the novel: what is it (if anything) that makes a human being human?<br /><strong><br />1. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/frankenstein-78.html\">Frankenstein by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/frankenstein-78.html\">Mary Shelley </a><br /></strong>Shelley’s novel ends somewhere near the North Pole, with the vengeful Victor Frankenstein driving his dog sled across the ice in an attempt to hunt down and kill the monster he has created. It is loneliness and a lack of human warmth that has made the monster monstrous, of course – he wants a wife but Victor refuses to make him one – and the bleak and empty landscape becomes the suitable final symbol of his terrible solitude.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/balloonist.html\">The Balloonist by MacDonald Harris</a><br /></strong>A Swedish aeronaut with mystical tendencies attempts to reach the North Pole by hydrogen balloon. The year is 1897, and modernisms of various kinds are in the air. Harris’s little-known novel is philosophically serious and frequently funny. Gustav, the protagonist and first-person narrator, has an arch, Nabokovian wit, and the theories he serves up about life and ballooning are provocative and plentiful.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/620/the-art-of-fiction-no-163-william-t-vollmann\">The Rifles by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/620/the-art-of-fiction-no-163-william-t-vollmann\">William T Vollmann</a><br /></strong>A wild, disorientating blend of reportage, history, historical fiction and oblique autobiography, The Rifles is volume six of Seven Dreams, Vollmann’s enormous and as yet unfinished account of the history of North American landscape. The protagonist, Captain Subzero, is a reincarnation (sort of) of John Franklin, the British explorer who famously disappeared while seeking the Northwest Passage. If you like Thomas Pynchon and William Gaddis, this is probably your kind of Arctic novel.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/01/fiction.martinamis\">House of Meetings by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/01/fiction.martinamis\">Martin Amis</a><br /></strong>The Siberian gulag novel might be considered a sub-genre of the Arctic novel proper. In its descriptions of the cruelty and brutality of everyday life in a Soviet-era prison camp, House of Meetings shows the influence of classic works by Dostoevsky and Solzhenitsyn. But in its complex, startling and often moving consideration of the psycho-sexual consequences of living under such dehumanising conditions, the novel is pure Amis.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Station_Zebra_(novel)\">Ice Station Zebra by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Station_Zebra_(novel)\">Alistair MacLean</a><br /></strong>An old-school 60s thriller set aboard a US nuclear submarine travelling below the Arctic ice pack. No women, no sex, very little explicit violence, but lots of details about submarine engineering, and plenty of strong, laconic men in situations of extreme peril. MacLean’s sentences are sometimes clunky and his characters (even the Americans) talk and think like Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots. But the plot is a juggernaut, and what other novel shows us the Arctic from underneath?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf01c37478f17253b4b012793ace46033885d2bd\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/cf01c37478f17253b4b012793ace46033885d2bd/0_470_1639_1171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ernest Borgnine in the 1968 film version of Ice Station Zebra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernest Borgnine in the 1968 film version of Ice Station Zebra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/reviews/980913.13kobakt.html\">The Voyage of the Narwhal by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/reviews/980913.13kobakt.html\">Andrea Barrett</a><br /></strong>Barrett’s novel takes John Franklin’s famous lost expedition as its starting point. The Narwhal leaves Philadelphia in 1855 in search of evidence of the fate of Franklin and his crew, but soon runs into difficulties of its own. The story shuttles intriguingly between the struggles of the men in Baffin Bay and those of the women left at home, and raises interesting questions about the ethics and psychology of Arctic exploration.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/call-of-the-wild-white-fang-and-other-stories-2.html\">The Call of the Wild by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/call-of-the-wild-white-fang-and-other-stories-2.html\">Jack London</a><br /></strong>Impossible to leave this one off the list. London’s work has the typical strengths and weaknesses of turn-of-the-century <a href=\"http://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/natural.htm\">naturalist fiction</a> – it’s powerful and gripping, but the ideas (a pinch of Nietzsche and Rousseau, and a large helping of Darwin) are very much of their time. In Call of the Wild, Buck the canine protagonist starts as a pampered pet in sunny California and ends up in the Yukon taking down caribou and running with the wolves. Or in other words: Nature 1, Nurture 0.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/discovery-of-slowness.html\">The Discovery of Slowness by Sten Nadolny</a><br /></strong>A quietly audacious historical novel that uses John Franklin’s life and career as the basis for some light-handed but absorbing philosophising. The slowness of the title refers specifically to Franklin’s extremely subdued and careful manners, and his disconcerting habit of pausing for a long time before answering any question, but it also comes to stand for a certain way of seeing and responding to the world. Being fast means relying on pre-existing ideas and assumptions; being slow means being open to seeing the world in new ways.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"http://www.otherpress.com/books/unformed-landscape/\">Unformed Landscape by Peter Stamm</a><br /></strong>Stamm’s beautiful short novel manages to be extraordinary while appearing to be quite plain. The writing is clean and simple and the story straightforward – a woman, Katherine, leaves her home in the far north of Norway after realising her husband is a liar, travels as far south as Paris, then returns to find a new partner – but every observation is emotionally acute, and (in Michael Hoffman’s excellent translation) every sentence rings completely true.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/393609/\">Katherine Carlyle by Rupert Thomson</a><br /></strong>Rupert Thomson’s most recent novel echoes the structure and some of the concerns of Stamm’s Unformed Landscape. Both novels trace longitudinal journeys of female self-discovery. But while in Stamm’s novel the main journey is from north to south, in Katherine Carlyle the protagonist, a young English woman bewildered by the death of her mother and the strangeness of her own IVF-assisted birth, leaves the warmth of Italy and travels north. She travels first to Berlin, and eventually to Outrograd a dismal mining town in Arctic Russia where the story reaches its uncertain conclusion.</p> <p>• The North Water by Ian McGuire is published by

She is left alone to explore hidden rooms and compose fantastical stories for Crowe’s valet, the lugubrious Eustace. But when Mr Crowe kills a stranger in an apparent crime of passion, the secret society of which he is a member arrives to extract justice. As Clara discovers the truth of Mr Crowe’s fabled talents, she must learn to master her own still greater gifts, in order to protect the people she loves.</p> <p>At its best, the prose in O’Donnell’s first novel is glorious, combining an ear for deep cadences of language with a phenomenal acuity of vision. Clara’s dream of swans on a lake is full of majesty: “It is spreading among them, the idea of flight, taking hold as a fire does.” Her sections are all lovingly described – and herein lies the rub.</p> <p>The narrative makes no distinction between events of importance and incidental actions. Everything is described in the same luxuriant, ponderous prose style. Later on, Clara takes two full pages to focus a pair of opera glasses – a skilful, even lyrical evocation of the experience of getting to grips with binoculars, but the activity is of no great consequence, nothing is at stake and we learn nothing about her character.</p> <p>While it would be gauche to demand that every sentence be shovelled like so much coke into the great furnace of plot, the density of information begins to tell. And while some sections are well observed, others – such as most of Eustace’s preparations for the arrival of the sinister Dr Chastern – are merely overlong, the narrative sagging into ersatz pastiche.</p> <p>This is partly a function of O’Donnell’s decision to hold back for as long as possible the exact nature of Mr Crowe’s talents and the secret order to which he belongs. The result is page after page of characters speaking in Zennish innuendos, in a manner that does not excite the reader’s intrigue so much as strains credulity. Even the characters seem exhausted by this. At one stage, a weary Eustace pleads with a long-time acquaintance to get to the point: “I am tired, Elias. There is some message in this, I suppose, but I cannot decipher it just now. You must be direct with me, I’m afraid.” “Forgive me,” said the acquaintance. “I have acquired a habit of circuitousness.”</p> <p>Two pages later Eustace must ask again: “You will have to speak more plainly, Elias, if this is to serve me. I do not follow you.”</p> <p>In moments like these you suspect O’Donnell of not playing fair with the reader. It’s one thing to reference tantalising morsels of nuggets not fully explained, quite another to make your characters so coy that they struggle to understand each other.</p> <p>But then, when the prose is good, it’s so very good that you feel like an ingrate for complaining. O’Donnell has a remarkable aptitude for capturing a character in a single action: “Wearily, but with the smooth economy of long habit, he rose and drew a dressing gown about him.”</p> <p>Suspense has certain economies of scale. After a punchy start, <em>The Maker of Swans</em> settles into a pace that mimics Clara’s “dense and fastidious” handwriting, laying out every subtext, every implicit motivation, like so many silk ties for the reader’s perusal. At the same time, vital revelations about past injustices and Clara’s gifts come so late that, for most of the novel, the reader has no idea what is at stake. O’Donnell is clearly a major talent, but this effort suffers from a preponderance of nest-circling and a dearth of eggs.</p> <p>Tim Clare’s <em>The Honours</em> is published by Canongate.• To order <em>The Maker of Swans</em> for £10.39 (RRP £12.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/375893/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

The Anglican author suggests that vice is not to be prohibited, but is ‘something with which we need to develop a constructive relationship’","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Some people think sex is sinful, while others think sin is sexy. The glamour of evil is the reason half the postgraduate English students in the world seem to be working on vampires and the gothic. Traditionally, however, it is virtue that is beguiling and vice that is boring. For Aristotle and Aquinas, the good life is about living as exuberantly as you can, whereas wickedness is a lack or defect. The wicked are those who have never quite got the hang of being human. They are botched imitations of real human beings, flashy but depthless. Then there are the genuinely evil, who destroy others not for some practical purpose but just for the obscene delight of it. The immoral are two a penny, but the evil are as rare a species as Tea Party intellectuals.</p> <p>How, then, did wickedness become so alluring? Part of the answer may lie in that legendary phenomenon: the rise of the middle classes. Once the merchants and accountants got their hands on virtue, redefining it as prudence, thrift, chastity, meekness, sobriety, self-discipline and so on, vice was bound to appear alluring by contrast. Dickens’s Fagin has a larger fan club than Oliver Twist. There is also the English tradition of the devil-may-care patrician, from Byron to Boris Johnson, whose appeal lies in his roguery.</p> <p>The dark side of the soul, in Stephen Cherry’s new book, turns out to be simply a dozen or so shades of grey. Turning his eyes from war, genocide, famine, rape and exploitation, Cherry takes us instead on a gentle guided tour of such notable moral atrocities as snobbery, vanity, hypocrisy, talkativeness, defensiveness, perfectionism and intoxication. It is the moral life as viewed from the senior common room of King’s College, Cambridge, where Cherry is dean.</p> <p>The book opens unpropitiously, with the claim that the main problem with vice is that it does harm to oneself, whereas personally speaking I don’t care much what moral damage a serial killer inflicts on himself as long as he keeps his hands off my throat. In the generous spirit of liberal Anglicanism, Cherry argues that vice is not to be excluded, prohibited or exorcised, but is “something with which we need to develop a critical and constructive relationship”. Developing a critical and constructive relationship with one’s habit of selling migrant workers into slavery is admittedly not easy to cultivate, but the book offers us a degree of comfort here, insisting that immorality is not something we can ever eradicate. If Cherry means by this that one just has to accept that one is a professional blackmailer, then it would be interesting to know the Anglican bishops’ opinion of this view. Not much can be done, he thinks, about the dark side of the soul, because “it is, after all, dark”. This is a bit like claiming that there is nothing much to be done about belabouring someone with an iron bar because it is, after all, an iron bar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The conceited 'are in many ways like the arrogant', and politeness is, apparently, the most fundamental of the virtues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is more moral wisdom on offer. We are told that “the lonely heart is always a heart seeking fulfilment in the give and take of relationships”, and that if we look into our own tarnished souls we will be less inclined to believe that others are monsters of evil. It is not clear how a spot of introspection might result in letting Goebbels off the hook. There is some talk of the seven deadly sins, or “deadlies”, as Cherry jocularly calls them, quite a few of which don’t seem all that lethal at all. Overeating, possibly with the odd riotous evening at high table in mind, is held up as the very paradigm of “the complex and insidious” nature of sin.</p> <p>Cherry is also a bearer of the surprising news that “different people respond differently to different intoxicants”, perhaps from long experience of his colleagues’ behaviour at college dessert. Mysteriously, the sin of vanity is described as “tragic”. The conceited, it transpires, “are in many ways like the arrogant”, and politeness is the most fundamental of the virtues. Readers to whom the thought has never occurred are admonished that “it is better to admire than envy”. In a brief phrenological sketch of history, we learn that “the Renaissance was a good time for the right hemisphere but as it progressed towards the Enlightenment so left-hemisphere functioning began to predominate”.</p> <p>A feelgood culture such as our own is allergic to ideas of sin and wickedness, which is one reason that this book is an opportunity fatally missed. It might have argued that those who reject what is traditionally known as sin either have some fancy spiritualistic conception of it, or simply haven’t been reading the newspapers. Instead, it helps to confirm the view that the church is as out of touch with actual vice as the Borgias were with saintliness.</p> <p><strong>• </strong>To order<strong> </strong><em>The Dark Side of the Soul</em><strong> </strong>for £13.59 (RRP £16.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/371244//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Melissa Keil. The YA scene has improved since the bad old Sweet Valley High days, but full inclusivity is still too rare","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>My first experience of the power of a limited cultural mirror emerged in my pre-teens. The books that I devoured consisted mostly of the American serials that dominated the children’s library shelves at the time, full of characters that I could only dream of emulating. I demolished piles of Sweet Valley High novels – the Wakefield twins were probably my first tween obsessions, the first characters who, with a burning envy, I wanted to be like. This pair of pretty, popular Californian girls who were, as was emphasised in every book, perfect – from their perfect size six figures, to their perfect blonde hair and perfectly perfect blue-green eyes.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1a236c0580b27d8934b21dc18c1aa806b59ee9f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f1a236c0580b27d8934b21dc18c1aa806b59ee9f/0_0_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Valley High girls ...

Brittany and Cynthia Daniel in the TV adaptation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alpha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Growing up in Australia, the bodies that pervaded my landscape, from magazines to TV to books, were predictable in their sameness: mostly white, tall and thin, blonde, sun-kissed, and – being Australia – perpetually bikini-clad. Needless to say, for teenage me – short, brown, built like a rather formless twig, and wholly unable to master the secret of tousled beach-hair – this ever-present representation was the source of some confusion.</p> <p>Yet I still buried my head in books, choosing to be wilfully blinkered to the fact that none of the characters I read and loved looked anything like me. I accepted, without much critical thought, that someone who was not beautiful, thin and white, could only ever exist on the margins of a story – sometimes in the background, occasionally the sidekick, but never the hero. Difference, when it existed, was often only a narrative driver of change, something to be fought and overcome – the fat character finding happiness by losing weight, the nerd obtaining a life-changing makeover. </p> <p>Empathy for fictional characters is a curious thing. To connect with people on the page requires a measure of identification, a willingness to place ourselves inside the heart and mind of another being. We cheer their successes and are moved by their plights because we’re capable of understanding their motivations, desires and fears. We can imagine what it’s like to walk in their shoes, or we aspire for a heroic, romantic, adventurous life that’s just like theirs. We understand, and share, their humanity. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/23/malorie-blackman-teen-young-adult-fiction-diversity-amnesty-teen-takeover-2014\">Malorie Blackman: &quot;Children's books still have a long way to go before they are truly diverse.&quot;</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Imagine, then, the cumulative effect of not seeing yourself reflected in that same cultural mirror. To exist in a body that is rarely allowed to stand in the narrative spotlight, or is only ever included as a problem to be solved. A body that, if it appears at all, must be discontented with its “otherness”, that is never allowed to wield the sword or fly the spaceship or be the romantic interest. The reasonable assumption is that your humanity is somehow lesser – less deserving of attention, less capable of carrying a story, less worthy of empathy. </p> <p>Books, particularly books for young people, have an incredible ability to be a source of acknowledgment and celebration, at a time when these things can be critical. To see yourself represented – not as a curiosity or a caricature, but as a full, interesting and complex being – can be soul-saving. And not just because seeing yourself matters; but because knowing that other people in the big wide world are reading and connecting with someone like you matters, too. </p> <p>Thankfully, the contemporary YA landscape has changed a bit since my teens. Diversity is at the forefront of conversations, and new books seems to arrive every year featuring lead characters who challenge the archetype of what I once believed they could be. Campaigns like <a href=\"http://www.weneeddiversebooks.org\">#WeNeedDiverseBooks</a> are leading discussions about the responsibilities that books have to better represent both their readership and the world in which that readership lives. They’re welcome changes, but it’s a conversation that is still evolving; it’s worth noting that the new editions of the Sweet Valley High books, in an effort to modernise some “dated” references, have reduced the Wakefields’ perfect size six figures to a perfect size four. The quest for inclusivity, in all its forms, continues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/14/what-are-the-best-books-on-diversity-for-children-and-teenagers\">What are the best diverse books for children and teenagers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The heroine of my novel, The Incredible Adventures of Cinnamon Girl, is in some respects a teenage girl that I wished my teen self could have read – confident, capable, and with a guilt-free sense of self-love. I wanted her to be a young woman who could enjoy her body without shame, and celebrate it without obsession. Equally, I wanted her to be comfortable in her own skin without any judgement on other girls; her solid sense of self isn’t reliant on comparison. She has no doubts that she is deserving of love, but in the tradition of all romantic comedies, needs to overcome various obstacles to realise it. She struggles with issues – how to best make use of her talents, and where her life is leading in her messy post-high-school world. Her body isn’t erased, but her place at the centre of the story isn’t predicated on it.</p> <p>Everyone deserves to see themselves as a hero – to see their life, their reality, in all its complexity, reflected in their books. For young people, at a time in their lives that can be isolating, and fraught with questions of body image, sexuality and identity, this representation can be vital. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/01/we-need-diverse-books-campaign-children\">'We Need Diverse Books' calls for more representative writing for children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But perhaps equally importantly, every reader deserves to have a full range of humanity represented in their fiction. We should crave stories about people of all sizes, shapes, colours and orientations – whose narrative place isn’t a given because of or in spite of their “otherness”, but who exist in our books because they exist in the world.

caught and trained the kestrels. It changed him forever, and now finally he tells his story","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>For much of the last 100 years, before the buzzard barrelled out of the north and west to become the commonest raptor in Britain, our most familiar bird of prey was the kestrel. These small falcons secured their passage into the modern world by learning to exploit the grassed cuttings and embankments of motorways and main roads. There they hover and scour the terrain beneath them for their rodent prey. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gerard-manley-hopkins\">Gerard Manley Hopkins</a>’s poem <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/apr/01/windhover-gerard-manley-hopkins\">“The Windhover”</a> describes this action superbly well. “Wind-fucker” was another old name for the bird.</p> <p>But this hunting technique, their breathtaking ability to stop in the air, as well as their relatively small size and unglamorous diet, meant kestrels were little valued in falconry. The sport aped raptor taxonomy and devised its own spurious pedigree. The top of the human social ladder were supposed to take on the most charismatic avian hunters, emperors trained eagles and princes peregrines, while those on the bottom rungs, the ‘knaves’, had to make do with kestrels.</p> <p>One of Richard Hines’s skills as a teenage falconer in the 1960s, alongside his ability to rear and keep several wild kestrel fledglings that he took from their nests, was to turn the knave’s bird into a stooping falcon via his self-taught knack with a lure (scraps of meat tied to a weighted pad and swung on a line, as a lassoing cowboy might, close enough to the falcon to entice it to follow but not so close that it might catch at the meat). “Come on, Kes,” he’d call and the birds did his bidding.</p> <p>If this already sounds familiar it is thanks to Hines. It was his life with his kestrels that inspired his older brother Barry to write the novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/kestrel-for-a-knave-3.html\"><em>A Kestrel for a Knave</em></a> in 1968, which in turn led to Ken Loach’s film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kes\"><em>Kes</em></a> in 1969. Barry Hines wrote the screenplay for the film with Loach and the producer Tony Garnett; Richard Hines trained the three kestrels that starred alongside <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0103193/\">David (now Dai) Bradley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/colin-welland\">Colin Welland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0323093/\">Brian Glover</a>. The book has been widely taught in schools and reissued as a modern classic; the film, beautifully performed, moving and funny, is among the most successful of Loach’s, and almost certainly his most popular.</p> <p>Hines’s memoir comes to the story slightly late in the day and somewhat apologetically. It is not quite sure whether it wants to correct what we know and push his name up the ladder of the credits, or, with more generous intentions, to show a deeper and more extended truth around the fictions. I think it is a bit of both. Nonetheless, it is certainly worth having. And its plain-spoken and unflashy but eloquent account, as its title suggests, of all sorts of gentleness, first to do with the taming of meat-eating raptors, but then also related to Hines’s human kith and kin, runs deep into the literature of birds and people: the seeing through birds that some people crave – an understanding of how the world works – and the way those people are simultaneously seen through – sustained and nurtured – by those same birds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are reminded that those who have sought out these birds of prey have often been wounded or troubled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hines was born in 1945 and brought up in the pit village of Hoyland Common south of Barnsley. Its deep-dug black coal was hauled to the surface among green fields. A grandfather died in a mine accident and his father began his working life aged 14 as a pit-pony driver: he was wounded with a gash to his head that filled with coal dust leaving him with a permanent scar “as deep blue as a tattoo”. Life was hard. The toilet they shared with their neighbours was 30 yards from their door. Deaths and injuries in the colliery marked all village life. And failure, too, soon came to call. Barry got into a grammar school but “halfwit” Richard was shunted towards the terminus of a secondary modern. Then he saw a kestrel hovering nearby, “so aloof, so wild”, and, as it has to in books such as this, his world was turned over and he was “captivated” by “wildness” – “I knew that I’d love to bring one into my life,” he writes.</p> <p>Richard takes a kestrel from its nest. There is no one to tell him what to do next: falconry is for posh people. He copies out a hawking book he finds in the reference section of his library, and plans to cannibalise a pair of his mother’s leather gloves for jesses (straps). I doesn’t go swimmingly. The first kestrel died when being cared for by Barry. Richard stalls at times and forfeits chances to escape the cage of his youth. He wins prizes and comes top of the class, moves to the grammar and captains its rugby team, but quits and repeatedly sabotages himself, while Barry is always ahead of him, in his V-necked sweater with its sleeves pushed up, getting on. Meanwhile, their dad dies, his “kind, gentle face” looking out from his open coffin.</p> <p>Hines’s sweet title comes from a 17th-century falconry manual. And gentleness sweetly pushes through much of his book, with the words kind and gentle oozing a little too obviously and too often from its pages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55fef94697d6a5137c064a94574a8be793158fb9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/55fef94697d6a5137c064a94574a8be793158fb9/0_0_2432_4320/563.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Hines\" width=\"563\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Hines, the real-life Billy Casper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hines tamed himself at last and made a success of his life thanks to his skills at manning his falcons. He grew up and became a teacher and a documentary film-maker. His parents, brother and friends were mostly kind to him. A Nigerian schoolboy he taught on a VSO secondment was kind; so were the women supporters of the miners’ strikes he made films about.</p> <p>Something falters once again in the final third of the book. After the hazards and excitement of training kestrels for the camera, and the thrill of seeing his own skills (his gentleness and love) acknowledged in a novel and on screen, Hines backs out of his story. He became a vegetarian, having read <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ethics-of-what-we-eat.html\">Peter Singer</a>, and he stopped keeping falcons (though there is a beautiful coda of a last merlin learning to catch its own meadow pipits). Hines’s brother went on to write more novels and screenplays but disappears before the end the book. And the book itself comes to a halt, riven with unsorted class and status anxieties that refresh old scars. Perhaps Hines’s mother preferred her first son. Perhaps that son never was able to see his younger brother for what he was. Nor could falconry ever offer a real escape: the knave seems doomed to remain a knave no matter how adroitly he handles his kestrel. Meeting a more privileged falconer brings home to Hines the hierarchies of power intrinsic to the sport. And we are reminded that those who have sought out these birds of prey have often been wounded or troubled or have sick souls. Hines mentions the influence of two great but damaged texts: TH White’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/309430/\"><em>The Goshawk</em> </a>and JA Baker’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/peregrine.html\"><em>The Peregrine</em></a>. And, inevitably, there are passages in his book that will remind readers of Helen Macdonald’s 2014 prize-winning memoir <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/h-is-for-hawk.html\"><em>H Is for Hawk</em></a>.</p> <p>Falconry often has sad ends – Macdonald’s Mabel, who had done so much to mend her falconer, dies of an infection in an aviary; White’s goshawk flees its keeper, dragging its ensnaring jesses behind it; even Baker’s soft-footed stalk of a sleeping wild peregrine is black-rimmed with a sense of a sick man approaching a sickly bird. Hines’s best end is different from these and isn’t where his book finishes. It is in the fleetingly mentioned fact that – unlike those moribund hawks and falcons – all the kestrels that he successfully reared and flew were hacked back after a season or a year, returned to the wild and restored to their lives. The gentleness that had kept them also let them go.</p> <p>• Tim Dee’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/four-fields-2.html\"><em>Four Fields</em></a> is published by Vintage.

The first recounted that history from the Native American point of view and, in the process, highlighted the full extent of the long genocide of America’s native people.

I immediately started thinking of new ways to tell stories with images. Around the same time a friend gave me a copy of Dee Brown’s book, and that was another eye-opener. The idea for Lost in the Wilderness came soon afterwards, and I’ve been working on it ever since.”</p> <p>The book revisits the scene of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/01/wounded-knee-national-monument\">Wounded Knee massacre</a>, the pivotal moment when, in 1890, the US Calvary killed more than 200 men, women and children at a camp on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Lathigra spent several months travelling through the region and meeting local people – tribal elders, teenagers, activists. “I used a medium-format camera, which makes you work more slowly. I wanted the images to be ambiguous and yet have a lingering power, not least because that’s the effect the place had on me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80999a402a1cff7d052a91f3858a610c2471face\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/80999a402a1cff7d052a91f3858a610c2471face/0_0_9000_7234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a portrait from Kalpesh Lathigra’s Lost in the Wilderness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quietly intense … a portrait from Kalpesh Lathigra’s Lost in the Wilderness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His landscapes often seem to carry echoes of the past, whether a blood-smeared field after a buffalo hunt or the often deliberately low-key monuments that mark the site of massacres. Throughout, the big, wide skies and flat plains of the Dakotas and Wyoming lend an elemental melancholy to the images. “It sometimes seemed to me that it was haunted by death. It’s not just to do with what happened there historically, but the prevalence of youth suicides and car crashes among young Native Americans. I wanted to capture some of that rawness and the lack of hope as well as the dignity of the people, but in a quiet, reflective way.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/29/red-horse-stanford-university-native-american-drawings-battle-of-little-bighorn\">Red Horse: Native American drawings shed new light on Battle of Little Bighorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lost in the Wilderness moves between the intimate and the subtlety symbolic. It captures the reality of life on the reservations – the flat, barren land, drab rooms, careworn faces – as well as some moments of dark irony: the Custer Motel in the town of Custer in South Dakota, a wall in a Dairy Queen fast-food cafe covered in photographs of John Wayne as a cowboy. “I went there with some Lakota elders en route to Little Big Horn. It was both a surreal and intensely uncomfortable moment.” He has mischievously titled the image Marion, Dairy Queen, Custer, the “Marion” referring to Wayne’s distinctly non-macho given name.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adedb45fab2aa411494b366be87f33885b20ce11\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/adedb45fab2aa411494b366be87f33885b20ce11/0_0_9000_7234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deliberately low-key … the grave of a child who survived the Wounded Knee massacre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deliberately low-key … the grave of a child who survived the Wounded Knee massacre in a picture from Kalpesh Lathigra’s Lost in the Wilderness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout, certain images draw you back: a portrait of an elder called Vincent Brings Plenty, standing alone on what looks like a suburban chalet park; the stark functionalism of St John’s Church, Oglala, where the few survivors of Wounded Knee were taken by Christian missionaries; the grave of Lost Bird, who, as a child, survived the massacre, protected by her mother’s fallen body, and whose remains were returned there a century later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/07/native-american-photographs-matika-wilbur-project-562\">One woman's mission to photograph every Native American tribe in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In one quietly intense portrait, two young men in hoodies stand by some gas cylinders, their aged eyes speaking of resilience and lives lived on the periphery. “I always identified with the so-called Red Indians in cowboys-and-indians films as a child because of my Indian – as in the subcontinent – heritage,” says Kalpesh, “and because I was seen as somehow different, even in multicultural London. But I was shocked to encounter the casual racism that attends these young men’s lives. More than once I heard people say of the Native American communities, ‘Why don’t they get with the programme?’ The inference was that they need to fit in, be less different and somehow more American. The irony seemed lost on the people who said it, but it always made me angry in my gut.”</p> <p>That anger no doubt runs through Lost in the Wilderness, but beyond that is the deeper narrative of a people surviving, and retaining their culture and traditions – their way of life – against the odds.</p> <p><em>• </em>Lost in the Wilderness is available at <a href=\"http://www.kalpeshlathigra.com/publications/\">kalpeshlathigra.com</a>, price £35.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gnn9","wordcount":"755","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c00f943ed898ff0b8969d1a18b787a68aac190fd/0_1128_8955_5369/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-20T07:00:16Z","standfirst":"<p>The US cavalry killed more than 200 Native Americans at Wounded Knee in 1890.

The BBC edition of the novel sold 3,581 copies last week, putting it in 50th place in the charts, <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/tolstoy-scores-first-nielsen-top-50-hit-322498\">according to the Bookseller</a>, with total sales for the BBC edition now more than 13,000 since its December release. Five other editions of War and Peace have also sold strongly, with combined sales of 2,438 copies last week.</p> <p>The strong sales follow YouGov’s recent survey, which found that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/21/dont-read-classic-books-because-you-should-war-peace-fun\">only 4% of Britons have read War and Peace</a>, although 14% wish they had. A study commissioned by BBC Store also said that War and Peace was in the top five works of fiction people are most likely to lie about having read.</p> <p>“Judging by our recent sales … an awful lot of people have finally crossed this classic off their must-read list. Four different editions of the book have hit our bestseller list, shifting an almost equal number of copies each,” said Waterstones buyer Joseph Knobbs.</p> <p>At publisher Wordsworth Editions, managing director Helen Trayler said that sales of War and Peace had grown steadily after the first episode of the new TV adaptation, with its edition in the top 20 of the Bookseller’s small publisher charts ever since the show launched. In total, Wordsworth has sold 56,157 copies in total of its 1993 edition of War and Peace, 3,054 of those since the television adaptation, according to the Bookseller.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/08/war-and-peace-literary-long-reads-recommendations\">War and Peace … and then what?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We saw similar sales increases on Dickens thanks to the BBC’s Dickensian series; also with Lady Chatterley’s Lover a few months ago.” said Trayler. “We raise our hats to the BBC – and other broadcasters – who bring these incredible classic literary works to the mass market. Although sometimes sniffed at by the academics, these adaptations are encouraging more people to read the classics.

Her favourite football player is about to get married, joining a long line of other married couples in her life. So why didn’t her parents ever have a wedding?</p> <p>She asks them. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“We’d love to be married,” said Mummy. </p> <p>“But what about you-know-who? We can’t have a wedding until they agree to come to the party,” Mumma said to Mummy.</p> <p>Phoebe didn’t know who you-know-who was. She decided to go ahead and organise a surprise wedding for her mummies anyway.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thus begins Mummy and Mumma Get Married, a children’s book by Byron Bay couple Roz Hopkins and Natalie Winter, with illustrations by Cara King, which was crowdfunded to completion earlier this year. Although Hopkins and Winter both have a background in the industry – they met at a publishing office – it’s their first book together. And although there are other Australian children’s picture books that feature alternative family types, from their knowledge it’s the first book in Australia to specifically focus on same-sex parents. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2016/feb/17/great-childrens-picture-books-about-same-sex-parenting-in-pictures\">Great children's picture books about same-sex parenting – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hopkins was surprised by the gap in the market, particularly compared with the US and the UK, where these types of books are much more common. “I suppose maybe it’s just a reflection of how behind the eight ball on the topic we are in Australia,” she says.</p> <p>Mummy and Mumma Get Married was conceived by Hopkins while she was trying to get her daughter, Dexie, to sleep, on 22 May – the same night as the Irish referendum after which that country became the first to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/23/gay-marriage-ireland-yes-vote\">legalise same-sex marriage by popular vote</a>. Under the conservative prime ministership of Tony Abbott, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-australia-and-gay-marriage-all-out-of-step-except-tony-abbott\">Australia seemed to be moving backwards</a> on the issue. “I was thinking about [my daughter] and how it would feel from her perspective, and how I wanted her to feel that she came from a structure that was recognised and validated.” Hopkins shared her idea with Dexie’s other mother the next day, and Winter started writing immediately. “I was at work, I came home, and she’d done it.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f415717b73f701b9f305a931d69cc14e0a56870\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8f415717b73f701b9f305a931d69cc14e0a56870/0_0_2398_1381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mummy and Mumma get Married (2016)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spread from Mummy and Mumma Get Married, by Roz Hopkins and Natalie Winter, with illustrations by Cara King.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cara King/Captain Honey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story follows Phoebe’s attempt to organise a surprise wedding for her mothers, inviting their friends and family, while retaining a hope that “you-know-who” shows up. </p> <p>“We had to change that in production,” Hopkins laughs. “The text originally read ‘a certain someone’, and it was much clearer that that ‘certain someone’ was Tony Abbott. The ending was a little bit different too, because this certain someone was always ‘late to the party’. It was a very deliberate pun on him.” </p> <p>But then the 2015 leadership spill happened, and the book had to change. “At the beginning I was thinking ‘how am I gonna do this?’ ... But as we began to think about ‘you-know-who’, it became much clearer to me that actually, while the political parties, the prime minister and those institutions of power and authority do provide obstacles, there’s also somebody in most people’s lives who is a you-know-who – it might be a father, a grandmother, an uncle. It could be anybody.”</p> <p>The final page still features a man who looks suspiciously not <em>un</em>like Tony Abbott, but he’s joined by a priest, a judge, the queen, and – being helicoptered in – an extended family, all there to celebrate the wedding. “You-know-who arrived just in time,” it reads. </p> <p>Hopkins thinks the change is for the better: “I didn’t want too much of a political agenda,” she says. But the agenda is hard to miss. In fact, along with the time-sensitive nature of the project, it was part of the reason the pair chose to release it themselves, rather than going with a traditional publisher. </p> <p>“We both know from our experience that when you work in-house with a traditional publisher you get lots of different people involved – sales and marketing, all these kinds – and we just didn’t want that, and we didn’t have time for it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"87d96c124fe7312bdeb3067e59f8938ca40b1140\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/87d96c124fe7312bdeb3067e59f8938ca40b1140/0_0_2398_2757/870.jpg\" alt=\"Mummy and Mumma Get Married (2016)\" width=\"870\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover of Mummy and Mumma Get Married, which the authors say is Australia’s first picture book to address same-sex families.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cara King/Captain Honey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book is clearly aimed at families of lesbian mums, but Hopkins and Winter always hoped it would reach a wider audience. Hopkins says it’s “just as important” for children of heteronormative families to be exposed to alternative family structures as it is for children of those alternative families. But while the publishers they approached for help with distribution were initially supportive, they didn’t end up helping. “I feel that publishers like to be seen to be associated with these [progressive titles], but they also know that they’re – how can I put this – they probably see them as niche.”<br /></p> <p>Instead, they went with a crowdfunding campaign, which raised $7,500 in 30 days, well above their $5,000 target. As part of the campaign, people could choose to buy a book themselves, donate one to a school library, or both. </p> <p>Not all of those schools were happy recipients. “One or two schools wrote to me saying they would refuse – ‘We will pass on the donation, thank you.’ A couple of Catholic schools,” Hopkins says. But a few supporters sent their books to Catholic schools regardless. “It wasn’t my idea!” she laughs. “But I’m sure there’ll be some feedback coming through about it soon.”</p> <p>As they endeavour to move the rest of their product, the pair plans to organise a speaking tour around secondary schools; they’ve put together 14 pages of teaching notes to go with it, too. “It just feels like momentum is going to keep building, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/30/maya-newell-2015-gayby-baby-we-learned-some-things-need-to-get-ugly-for-change\">the Gayby Baby controversy</a> at the end of last year, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/play-school-puts-out-casting-call-for-child-with-two-dads-to-show-diverse-families\">the Play School [casting call for gay parents]</a> this month,” Hopkins says. “The political aspect is being slowed down ... but marriage equality will, I think, happen as soon as it can happen. It feels like all the energy is moving in the right direction.”</p> <p>But a little nudge can’t hurt. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ecc85b4d5a466ba99f60bd7a0c8a0afe82183fb\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9ecc85b4d5a466ba99f60bd7a0c8a0afe82183fb/0_0_2398_1381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spread from Mummy and Mumma Get Married\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spread from Mummy and Mumma Get Married by Roz Hopkins and Natalie Winter, with illustrations by Cara King</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cara King/Captain Honey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><em>Mummy and Mumma Get Married is available through <a href=\"http://captainhoney.com.au/portfolio_page/mummy-and-mumma-get-married/\">Captain Honey</a></em></li> </ul>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ght4","wordcount":"986","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9ecc85b4d5a466ba99f60bd7a0c8a0afe82183fb/0_236_1088_654/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-20T03:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Mummy and Mumma Get Married follows a young girl who wants to surprise her parents with a wedding.

I say ‘their’ because the book avoids identifying the child as male or female, which makes it great for parents of boys and girls. <br><br>It’s a very simple rhyming book, with simple illustrations – it’s for young readers. A strength is its focus on the everyday, which normalises having two mothers, rather than drawing attention to it. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Daddy-Papa-Me-Lesl%C3%A9a-Newman/dp/1582462623\">Daddy, Papa and Me</a> was published that year too.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Carol Thompson/Tricycle Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fa0fa21e0d51d351e751f0fcab5d739187e1994\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2fa0fa21e0d51d351e751f0fcab5d739187e1994/0_0_1024_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of It's Okay to be Different by Todd Parr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While not specifically on the same-sex theme, American author Todd Parr does a wonderful job of speaking to kids from different backgrounds with books such as It’s Okay to Be Different (2009) and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mommy-Book-Todd-Parr/dp/0316070440/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455597113&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=todd+parr+the+mommy+book\">the Mommy Book</a> (2010). A lot of lesbian mums I know have cited these titles as important for teaching their children the value of difference. <br><br>What really appeals to me about Parr’s books are the bold, graphic illustration styles which – paired with short, simple text – make for an easy and fun way to get a message across.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Todd Parr/Little Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b83e1e2dbcbf1d990ce33483096becb3355ea57\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b83e1e2dbcbf1d990ce33483096becb3355ea57/0_0_2801_2782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Stella Brings the Family, by Miriam B Schiffer and Holly Clifton-Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"993\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella Brings the Family, by Miriam B Schiffer and Holly Clifton-Brown, is an equivalent to Heather Has Two Mommies, but for children with gay dads. <br><br>In this story, a little girl struggles with how to respond when asked to bring her mother to school on Mother’s Day. She finds a great solution by bringing all the people who love her. <br><br>This is a sweet story about love and acceptance.

all too easy to get lost in translation","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> To ignore Stanley Mitchell’s achievement is an injustice to a remarkable translator","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I was disappointed that in his review of Anthony Briggs’s new translation of Yevgeny Onegin (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/09/yevgeny-onegin-alexander-pushkin-review-expert-new-translation\" title=\"\">Review</a>, 13 February), Nicholas Lezard omits all mention of the recent and brilliant translation by the late Stanley Mitchell. He has of course his reasons for praising Briggs, but to ignore Mitchell’s achievement is an injustice to a remarkable translator. A decent respect for translators is sadly rare: in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/13/human-acts-han-kang-review-south-korea\" title=\"\">her review of Han Kang’s Human Acts</a>, Eimear McBride doesn’t even name Deborah Smith, without whose rare knowledge of Korean, English-speaking readers would have no access to Han Kang’s work. <br /><strong>Donald Rayfield</strong><br /><em>Emeritus professor of Russian and Georgian, Queen Mary University of London</em></p> <p>• I am sorry to read that David Harewood was in a deep depression and considered giving up acting, (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/15/david-harewood-depression-almost-quit-acting-lorry-driver\" title=\"\">CIA rescue: Homeland saved actor from lorries</a>, 16 February) but is it appropriate to refer to him as being “saved” from being a lorry driver? To be a lorry driver you have be licensed after passing rigorous tests, commonly having trained at your own expense, and you have to undertake ongoing training. It is a responsible and often stressful job which is essential to the functioning of our society. The acting profession might well have been poorer without David Harewood’s input but lorry driving is also an honourable career worthy of respect.<br /><strong>Janet Mearns</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• We shall particularly miss the Independent on Sunday’s annual publication of The Happy List (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/14/fleet-street-will-be-a-sadder-place-without-the-indy\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 15 February). Begun in 2008 and hailed as an antidote to the Sunday Times Rich List, it acknowledged the unsung army of ordinary people who, by their deeds, make Britain a better balanced, happier country. It was also a relief to read good news in the media. Perhaps the Guardian could follow suit?<br /><strong>Carole Coleman</strong><br /><em>Halifax, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• I note that Stephen Fry has quit Twitter, again (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/stephen-fry-deletes-twitter-account-after-baftas-bag-lady-offence\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 16 February). Surely it is now time for him to try writing a letter to the letters page, where he will find, by contrast, edited and reasoned debate.<br /><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• Doubtless we should all be in awe of the fact that “we have seen ripples in space-time!” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-science-thrilled-by-discovery-ripples-in-space-time\" title=\"\">Gravitational waves</a>, 12 February), but is it actually possible “to have a whole new picture … of the stuff that doesn’t emit light” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\" title=\"\">as Prof Neil Turok claims</a>? Surely that’s the deceit of any black mass?<br /><strong>Fr Alec Mitchell</strong><br /><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>• In response to the danger of banging on about the big bang (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/14/the-danger-of-banging-on-about-the-big-bang\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 15 February) let’s not claim either that we were specially created by an omnipotent being.

In this extract from his new book, Idiot Brain, neuroscientist Dean Burnett explains the link between motion and vomiting","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Modern humans spend a lot more time sitting down than any previous generation. Manual labour jobs have largely been replaced by office jobs; cars and other means of transport allow us to travel while sitting down. This has its downsides. Obscene sums are spent on ergonomically designed office chairs to ensure people don’t get damaged or injured due to excessive sitting. Sitting too long on an aeroplane can even be fatal, due to deep vein thrombosis. It seems odd, but staying very still is bad for us.</p> <p>Because moving is important. Humans are good at it and we do it a lot, as evidenced by the fact that, as a species, we’ve pretty much covered the surface of the Earth, and actually been to the moon. Our skeletons have evolved to allow long periods of walking, as the arrangement and properties of our feet, legs, hips and general body layout are ideally suited to regular ambulation. But if moving is integral to our wellbeing and survival, why does it sometimes make us throw up?</p> <p>This is the phenomenon known as motion sickness or travel sickness. Sometimes, often apropos of nothing, being in transit makes us bring up our breakfast, lose our lunch, or eject some other more recent but non-alliterative meal. It is the brain that is actually responsible for this, not the stomach or innards (despite how it may feel at the time). What possible reason could there be for our brains to conclude, in defiance of aeons of evolution, that going from A to B is a legitimate cause for vomiting? In actual fact, the brain isn’t defying our evolved tendencies at all.</p> <p>It is the numerous systems and mechanisms we have to facilitate motion that are causing the problem. Motion sickness occurs only when you’re travelling by artificial means – in a vehicle. Humans have a sophisticated array of senses and neurological mechanisms that give rise to proprioception: the ability to sense how our body is currently arranged, and which parts are going where. There is also the vestibular system, found in our inner ear. It is a bunch of fluid-filled canals that detect our balance and position. There is enough space in there for fluid to move about in response to gravity, and there are neurons throughout it that can detect the location and arrangement of the fluids, letting our brain know our current position and orientation.</p> <p>Human motion produces a very specific set of signals. There is the steady up-down rocking motion inherent in bipedal walking, the general velocity and the external forces that this produces. All these are detected by proprioception and the vestibular system. The image hitting our eyes is one of the outside world going by. The same image could be caused either by us moving, or by us staying still and the outside world going past. At the most basic level, both are valid interpretations. How does the brain know which is right? It receives the visual information, couples it with the information from the fluid system in the ear and concludes: “Body is moving; this is normal.” Our eyes and inner systems work together to explain what’s going on.</p> <p>Movement via a vehicle produces a different set of sensations. When you are being transported, you’re not the one actually “doing” the moving; you’re just sitting there. Your proprioception isn’t producing all those clever signals for the brain to comprehend what is going on. But you are actually moving, and the aforementioned fluids in your ear, responding to the forces caused by high-speed movement and acceleration, are sending signals to the brain saying you are travelling, and quite fast at that. The brain is getting mixed signals from a precisely calibrated motion-detection system, and it is believed that this is what causes motion sickness. </p> <p>The deeper, more fundamental subconscious systems that regulate our bodies don’t really know how to deal with such internal problems as this, and they have no idea what could possibly be happening. In fact, as far as the reptile brain is concerned, there is only one likely answer: poison. In nature, that is the only likely thing that can so deeply affect our inner workings and cause them to get so confused. Poison is bad, and if the brain thinks there is poison in the body, there is only one reasonable response: get rid of it, activate the vomiting reflex, pronto.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is an edited extract from The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett (Guardian Faber, £12.99).

A man reflects on love and sex in this extract from Chilean poet Enrique Winter’s new work, Bin Bags","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Every morning Brian is in the habit of washing his arsehole with balsam, the way Eugenio used to like it. The upstairs bathroom is also shared, but it’s kept clean enough, because of the big window and because he’s included in a rota that the girls on that floor had inherited from other girls. He lathers his legs, the hair’s growing back, and he asks himself how something so obvious––that if you love someone you never stop loving them, dead or alive––is mentioned neither by the people giving advice nor by those taking it. When you’ve loved someone, you’ll always love them. That’s all there is to it. He closes his eyes to rinse himself off. You can survive with that, with or without your loved ones. You don’t replace them, you add to them. He dries himself, some parts better shaven than others, and the towel keeps Eugenio at the forefront of his mind:<strong> </strong>once, Eugenio, wrapped in a towel, said he made people see what they didn’t know they didn’t want to see. Brian then demanded an explanation and Eugenio spoke at length while he got dressed about how he’d manage to provoke people who swore they were as liberal as can be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter whether they were men or women, he had always liked the bad ones</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brian could spend a long time sitting with his eyes fixed on the back of Eugenio’s knees, while he stood cooking. They were always the beginning of something and Eugenio let him look—with one foot he could stroke his calf as though itching it, or straighten out his shorts with one hand without taking the other off the frying pan or plate or whatever it was. He would whistle or sing slowly, and Brian heard the tune as though it was coming directly from those knees, bending every now and again, hinting at the thighs beyond, which he wouldn’t see until later. But Brian would always touch them through Eugenio’s shorts without even getting up from the sofa they had in the kitchen. With just his nails or his fingertips, he’d trace the edges of his boxer shorts until he was told to stop. But that didn’t always happen, and sometimes the tap would be left running or the water would evaporate on the hob. When they’d finished fucking, Brian would become quite the chatterbox, and Eugenio would half listen from the kitchen, in his dressing gown. They never got dressed afterwards, even though it might be noon. And so Brian would recount from the bed how when he was younger he wrote down all his first kisses in a diary, believing he would be able to record them for the rest of his life, which Eugenio thought was cute, or how, no matter whether they were men or women, he had always liked the bad ones. Brian remembered the ones who would wait up the whole night without asking where you’d been, who would bring you chocolates, marzipan, remember everything you told them and ask how such-and-such a thing had gone last week, last month. If you weren’t a morning person they’d slide into your bed to wake you up, or, if they were sleeping with you, would wait until you woke up before leaving. There was one, he was so good to him, so optimistic, smiling all the time, but Brian wasn’t in love with him. It took him a long time to figure out whether he was only with him because he was a good guy––if he hadn’t looked after me so well I would have left him like a shot, he confessed to Eugenio, and Eugenio agreed––or, worse, whether he didn’t fall in love with him precisely because he was such a good guy. The reason he wanted him––I wouldn’t have let myself be the first to invite him for an ice cream or to dance, I don’t even remember how I met him, but I hadn’t liked him beforehand, that’s for sure––the reason he wanted him was perhaps the same reason he didn’t love him, the reason it started was the same reason it ended. I was suffocated, d’you get me, by wanting to love him, but it wasn’t his fault, not even when I was a little brat and secretly went out with the neighbour, remember Elder?<br /></p> <p>“Yes! A waste of space that guy, but I don’t understand why you still go for the bad ones now,” Eugenio asked him once, less distracted than usual.<br /></p> <p>“I dunno, because I’m one of the good ones, I guess, right?”<br /></p> <p>“All you are is <em>loco</em>––and mind, because they beat <em>locos</em> round here.”<br /></p> <p>Eugenio’s response to other questions varied between treating him like a submissive, pretending to lash him with a whip, and saying “<em>locos</em> aren’t in season or I’d be eating you with lemon like <em>choros</em> or any other kind of seafood,” when he wouldn’t lay off his ridiculous attempt to distinguish between good and bad people, as if life was a soap opera.<br /></p> <p>Eugenio would also tell him what was on his mind, though he wouldn’t wait until after they’d fucked to do so, at any moment he might come out and say that he had a choice between living with someone who teased him and someone who satisfied him. When Brian asked whether he teased or satisfied him, Eugenio didn’t answer, but snuggled up to him<strong> </strong>until he forgot what they had been talking about, just like when he brought up being short of money, or whether he’d been out whoring when Brian was at work, or when Eugenio used to disappear for a couple of days and come back without any explanation, sometimes with bruises hidden underneath his make up. But he couldn’t hide them from Brian’s eyes, his eyes that seemed made for those knees. They tessellated. <br /></p> <p><em>Translated from the Spanish by Ellen Jones</em><br /></p> <p><em>*****</em></p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Enrique Winter</strong> (Santiago, Chile, 1982) is author of </em>Atar las naves<em> (winner of Víctor Jara Arts Festival), </em>Rascacielos<em> (available in English as </em><a href=\"http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/product/skyscrapers-enrique-winter-d%C3%ADazgrey-editores-new-book-translated-mary-ellen-stitt\">Skyscrapers</a><em>), </em>Guía de despacho<em> (winner of the National Young Poet Competition), </em>Lengua de señas<em> (Pablo de Rokha Poetry Prize; available in English as </em><a href=\"http://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2016/02/04/in-review-sign-tongue-by-enrique-winter/\">Sign Tongue</a><em>) and co-author of the LP </em>Agua en polvo<em>, collected in several anthologies and languages.

In this extract from his new book, Idiot Brain, neuroscientist Dean Burnett explains the chemical processes behind the heartbreak","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Have you ever found yourself in the foetal position on the sofa for days on end, curtains drawn, phone unanswered, moving only to haphazardly wipe the snot and tears from your face? All that has happened is you’ve been made aware that you won’t be seeing a person you had a lot of interaction with much any more. That’s it. So why does it leave you reeling for weeks, months, even for the rest of your life, in some cases?</p> <p>Humans seem primed to seek out and form monogamous romantic relationships, and this is reflected in a number of weird things the brain does when we end up falling for someone. Attraction is governed by many factors. Many species develop secondary sex characteristics, which are features that occur during sexual maturity but that aren’t directly involved in the reproductive process; for instance, a moose’s antlers or a peacock’s tail. They are impressive and show how fit and healthy the individual creature is, but they don’t do much beyond that. </p> <p>Humans are no different. As adults, we develop many features that are apparently largely for physically attracting others: the deep voice, enlarged frames and facial hair of men, or the protruding breasts and pronounced curves of women. None of these things are “essential”, but in the distant past, some of our ancestors decided that is what they wanted in a partner, and evolution took over from there. But then we end up with something of a chicken-and-egg scenario with regards to the brain, in that the human brain inherently finds certain features attractive because it has evolved to do so. Which came first, the attraction or the primitive brain’s recognition of it? Hard to say.</p> <p>It is important, however, to differentiate between a desire for sex, AKA lust, and the deeper, more personal attraction and bonding we associate with romance and love, things more often sought and found with long-term relationships. People can (and frequently do) enjoy purely physical sexual interactions with others that they have no real “fondness” for apart from an appreciation for their appearance, and even that is not essential. Sex is a tricky thing to pin down with the brain, as it underlies much of our adult thinking and behaviour. </p> <p>But this isn’t really about lust; we’re talking more about love, in the romantic sense, for one specific individual. There is a lot of evidence to suggest the brain processes love differently. Studies by Bartels and Zeki suggest that when individuals who describe themselves as in love are shown images of their romantic partners, there is raised activity (not seen in lust or more platonic relationships) in a network of brain regions including the medial insula, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus and putamen. </p> <p>There is also lower activity in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala. The posterior cingulate gyrus is often associated with painful emotion perception, so it makes sense that your loved one’s presence would shut this down a bit. The amygdala processes emotions and memory, but often for negative things such as fear and anger, so again, it makes sense that it’s not so active now. People in committed relationships can often seem more relaxed and less bothered about day-to-day annoyances, regularly coming across as “smug” to the independent observer.</p> <p>One type of chemical often associated with attraction are pheromones, specific substances given off in sweat that other individuals detect and that alter their behaviour. While human pheromones are regularly referred to (you can seemingly buy sprays laced with them if you’re looking to increase your sexual appeal), there is currently no definitive evidence that humans have specific pheromones that influence attraction and arousal. The brain may often be an idiot, but it is not so easily manipulated.</p> <p>However, being in love seems to elevate dopamine activity in the reward pathway, meaning we experience pleasure in our partner’s presence, almost like a drug. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2012/apr/09/pass-notes-oxytocin\">oxytocin is often referred to as the “love hormone”</a> or similar, which is a ridiculous oversimplification of a complex substance, but it does seem to be elevated in people in relationships, and it has been linked to feelings of trust and connection in humans.</p> <p>The flexibility of the brain means that, in response to all this deep and intense stuff, it adapts to expect it. And then it ends. Consider everything the brain invests in sustaining a relationship, all the changes it undergoes, all the value it places on being in one. If you remove all this in one fell swoop, the brain is going to be seriously negatively affected. All the positive sensations it has grown to expect suddenly cease, which is incredibly distressing for an organ that doesn’t deal with uncertainty and ambiguity well at all. Studies have shown that a relationship breakup activates the same brain regions that process physical pain.</p> <p>Addiction and withdrawal can be very disruptive and damaging to the brain, and a not dissimilar process is happening here. This isn’t to say the brain doesn’t have the ability to deal with a breakup. It can put everything back together eventually, even if it’s a slow process. Some experiments showed that specifically focusing on the positive outcomes of a breakup can cause more rapid recovery and growth. And, just sometimes, science and cliches match up, and things really do get better with time.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is an edited extract from The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett (Guardian Faber, £12.99).

But according to John Updike, “Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset … that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible”.</p> <p>Now the designer and writer Matt Steel is setting out to address Walden’s declining readership, with a new edition of the public domain text that adapts Thoreau’s 19th-century language for modern readers. Steel <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2001070129/the-new-walden\">launched a Kickstarter</a> to raise funds for his project on Tuesday, aiming to raise $104,000 (£72,000) to print 2,000 cloth hardback, illustrated copies of his adapted version. The finished book is due out in spring 2017 if the campaign is successful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to shorten the distance between 1854 and today so that the lyrical beauty of this excellent text can shine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“While widely quoted, Walden is rarely read anymore, and our society’s familiarity with the story is fading,” Steel said. “My theory is that there’s nothing wrong with the story. It’s the 19th-century language that’s problematic. By creating an updated version of Walden, I want to create more opportunities for other people’s lives to be enriched by this book.”</p> <p>When Steel himself first read the book, in 2014, it had “a profound impact” on him, he said. “Having gone through a period of career burnout, followed by radical lifestyle change, I could see that Thoreau’s ideas around simplicity, consumerism, and busy-ness had an uncanny relevance to the challenges we face today. I shared my enthusiasm for the book with anyone willing to listen. But I kept having to couch my recommendations: ‘This is an incredible book, but the 19th-century language is hard to digest at times. But stick with it, and you’ll be glad you did!’ This situation bothered me. I didn’t want to keep telling people they should read Walden – ‘but …’. I realised that what this story needs is to be updated for modern readers.”</p> <p>His new version neither abridges nor “dumb[s] down” Thoreau’s original text, he says. “A lot of the pleasure in reading Walden is Thoreau’s language. Walden has always been a dense, layered text. I think that’s part of what makes it a feast for the mind,” said Steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d02f97a2a49f450ce37e7cc4586c4f9d82fc47\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f5d02f97a2a49f450ce37e7cc4586c4f9d82fc47/109_0_3597_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pond for the 21st century ... a comparison of the language of the original and the new versions of Walden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pond for the 21st century ... a comparison of the language of the original and the new versions of Walden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vann Alexandra</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“To that end, I am not revising Walden to the point of removing any of Thoreau’s ideas or adding my own. I have no wish to impose my style or opinions on such a celebrated author. But I believe the degree to which the English language has changed over the past two centuries has made it harder for readers to get into this particular text. And because Walden was such a complex, layered work to begin with, and because of its ongoing relevance, it seemed particularly ripe for an update ... I want to shorten the distance between 1854 and today as much as possible, so that the lyrical beauty, wisdom, and power of this excellent text can shine.”</p> <p>Examples of the changes he has made include translations of Latin and Greek references, updated archaisms (“I would fain” becomes “I wish”), changes to outdated place names, and splitting Thoreau’s lengthy sentences up. He has also switched “men” for “people” throughout, when Thoreau is referring to humanity as a whole. The new version is sprinkled with pull quotes highlighting Thoreau’s “powerful one-liners”, such as “could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other’s eyes for an instant?” And at the end, a selection of the author’s “most arresting passages” are presented as prose poems.</p> <p>Steel has worked with the editor and poet <a href=\"http://talkinginthedark.com/\">Billy Merrell</a> on the text, and says that so far, much of the feedback from the literary community has been “delight and enthusiasm”. “A couple have been very sceptical. I’m sure that there will be strong reactions as more people discover this project,” said Steel. “I invite sceptics to read the original and my version side by side and then judge for themselves … I want people to know that I don’t intend to replace the original version of Walden. My version may serve as a replacement for some people, or a first-and-only version for others. But I see the two versions living side by side. If this project helps preserve Thoreau’s beautiful words and introduces him to new audiences, then I’ve done my job.”</p> <p>Should the Kickstarter prove successful, Steel envisages adapting other classics. “The loss of accessibility in books has been going on for millennia, as has the practice of updating them in order to prevent their disappearance. But I think we tend to wait too long. With this project, I hope to show the benefits of shortening revision cycles. I believe this will allow the world’s best stories to remain evergreen,” he said.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gnjm","wordcount":"958","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/236a13d12243fab89c8de776d372a50963d5431b/0_596_3000_1798/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Henry

But, in very specific circumstances, it can actually help recall. This is the phenomenon known as state-specific recall. External context can help you recall a memory; you’re better able to recall it if you are in the same environment where the memory was acquired. But, and here’s the clever bit, this also applies to the internal context, or “state”, hence state-dependent recall. To put it simply, substances such as alcohol or stimulants or anything that alters brain activity bring about a specific neurological state. When the brain is suddenly having to deal with a disruptive substance washing around everywhere, this does not go unnoticed, any more than you wouldn’t notice that your bedroom was suddenly full of smoke.</p> <p>This can also apply to mood: if you learn something while in a bad mood, you’re more likely to recall it later if you’re in a bad mood again. It is a massive oversimplification to describe moods and mood disorders as “chemical imbalances” in the brain (despite many who do just that), but the overall levels of chemical and electrochemical activity that result in and from a specific mood is something the brain can recognise, and does. Thus, the context inside your head is potentially just as useful as the one outside your head when it comes to triggering memories.</p> <p>Alcohol does disrupt memories, but only after a certain point; it’s perfectly possible to have the pleasant buzz of a few beers or glasses of wine and still remember everything the next day. But if you were to be told some interesting gossip or useful information after a couple of glasses of wine, your brain would encode your slightly intoxicated state as part of the memory, so would be better able to retrieve this memory if you were to have another couple of glasses of wine (on a different night, not right after the first two). In this scenario, a glass of wine can indeed improve your memory.<br /></p> <p>Please don’t take this as a scientific endorsement for drinking heavily when studying for exams or tests. Turning up drunk for a test will be problematic enough to cancel out any minor memory advantages this provides you with, especially if it’s a driving test.</p> <p>But there is still some hope for desperate students: caffeine affects the brain and produces a specific internal state that can help trigger memories, and a lot of students pull caffeine-fuelled all-nighters when cramming for exams. So if you attend the exams similarly stimulated by excessive caffeine, then it could well help with remembering some of the more important details from your notes.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is an edited extract from The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett (Guardian Faber, £12.99).

midday to 4pm. Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
